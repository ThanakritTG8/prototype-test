Lots of restaurants, bars and shopping nearby, easy to get a taxi, tuk tuk or local bus service (try it!) to Patong or Phuket city from here. When we were here in January 2020 it was packed with Chinese, but mainly Russian tourists. No doubt that has all changed with corona virus. I'm sure there will be many bargains to get tourists back when this finally blows over. It is just such a tragedy that the locals here were only just getting over the 2004 tsunami to be only hit by something almost as devastating all these years later.",

Granted, Patong is slightly better in terms of sand and water but overall we preferred the laid back aura at Karon. 100baht per sun bed and we were set for the day.",

Last time I visited Karon was in June 2015, and I remember the water being extremely choppy and we weren\u2019t allowed in the water due to the riptides. It wasn\u2019t the case this time and the water water very calm. I guess it changes within the next few months",

The water is sometimes very hot but clean and crystal clear. But when the beggining soma starts the tide, it goes back 90-100 meters and it gets a bit blurry.",

        "Review": "We\u2019ve been to Phuket many times for the past twelve years and Karon had always been our favourite beach. It is not as crowded as Patong, yet not too far away from the necessary amenities and good food. However, we are very disappointed that this trip since our last visit four years ago did not give us the same positive feelings about Thailand anymore. The influx of tourists from certain countries with many lacking in manners and consideration for others seems to have taken a toll on the locals. They have become less friendly and even rude to customers at times. We no longer experience the land of smiles, and customer service is poor if it exists at all. The infrastructure does not support the increase in the number of tourists visiting, and the whole place stunk like an open sewer. While we have met some friendly people this time, we are unlikely to visit this island again.",

        "Review": "We booked to stay in the Karon resort in Phuket so that we could dip in and out of the madness of Patong as we wanted a chilled out holiday. Having done trips to other parts of Thailand we realised that there are much more scenic places to stay. Karon Beach is large and crowded and nowhere near as pretty as the beaches we saw in Krabi and Phi Phi. Areas of the resort were pretty smelly and felt quite unclean...that said it was much more chilled out than Patong. It depends what you are looking for in Thailand but if I  were to visit the country again I would visit Krabi for sure.",

Even so when we did I felt like i should of been having lunch with the person next to us we were sat that close! The sand is lovely when you get down to the sea however the further back you go it is very dirty and full of rubbish.. I.e. cigarette buts, dead rats, plastic etc.We visited Nai Harn beach and this was 100 x's better! Don't waste your days on Karon beach.. get a took took to Nai Harn, it is well worth it!",
