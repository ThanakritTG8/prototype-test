Though being a long beach, there's usually room for all. Low season this beach sees the largest waves, thus attracting some surfers. There used to be a surf competition every August. Swimmers might want to take note this is quite a dangerous beach during low season and usually there's a warning red flag. Great for walks or simply chill on the beach",

        "Review": "The beach in Karon is beautiful in many ways. Clean, tidy and very sandy. The beach is wide so there is plenty of room to lay out a couple of towels if you don't want to hire a sunbed and parasol. The sea is lovely and warm but has a very strong under-currant so beware going out too far. A distinct lack of any toilets of any kind but that seems to be the case on a lot of beaches outside of Europe or the USA. No facilities for washing sand off of your feet etc. A little investment in these facilities would make life a whole lot better for foreign visitors that maybe used to them being in place. The sunsets here are beautiful  don't forget your camera. Overall the beach is fabulous.The main street in Karon is a very vibrant place with lots of bars and eating places (I'll refrain from using the word restaurant) to choose from. Lots of (iced) seafood on display and you can have lots of different foods cooked right in front of you if that's your thing. A few choice smells lingered in the air but nobody seems to bother about them. There is a large market at the top of the road which sells almost every sort of cooked thing you can think of including scorpions and all manner of insects etc. Lots of souvenirs and cheap clothing on offer too. A big stage had been erected when we visited with a variety of Thai entertainment going on. Short trips back to hotels or nearby attractions are easy by taking a ride in a tuk-tuk (with loud disco sounds and lighting if you like). All in all a very entertaining town. If you fancy a busier time, a short trip into Patong will enlighten the senses. Some very nice big shopping malls there. While you're there, a walk along Bangla Road is a must.",

Just of the beach is numerous bars shops and restaurants also local taxis and tuktuk service to take you back to your hotel. Visited the beach a few times during our stay as it was so nice. At the seas edge you can see big Buddha in the hills and kata view point over the other islands, its so relaxing and beautiful",

Negatives:- There's a build up of plastic and other litter on the beach that's been swept inland which is a shame. - Lack of toilets - the usual beach sellers constantly walking by offering to sell everything from food to sunglasses.

While I was taking photos I noticed that passanger right foot peg was missing and the aluminum where the foot peg should have been attached was broken, and there was \u201daluminium rust\u201d in the cracks and there was a lot of bubbles under the paint, obviously an old damage. I informed Tod about the damage but he said it was an old damage and nothing to worry about. The following next day when I returned the motorbike, Tod inspected the motorbike and told me that I have damaged the motorbike and that I have to pay for the foot peg and the broken aluminium plate where the foot peg should have been attached. I said that it was an old damaged and that I also informed them yesterday at the time of renting that there was a damaged/missing foot peg. He said that I did not informed them and that I still had to pay for the damaged. I then showed Tod the photos that I took 1 minute after the hiring contract was written the day before, he then told me that I took the photos after the damage was done, I then showed him the date and time that was logged on the photos, he said that I had manipulated the photo and that everyone can manipulate date and time on photos taken with mobile camera.I had some luck, because while we were standing there arguing a young couple came to rent a motorike- so loud and clear and so that nearby people could hear what I was saying I told the couple not to rent at Tod\u2019s place because he will try to make you pay for damages you not caused.Tod then turned to me and said ok here is your passport.Some of you will now say-never leave your passport as deposit, leave a copy of your passport instead. But then you will not be able to rent a motorbike, because they do not accept a copy, only passport. Now some of you will say- leave money as deposit together with a copy of the passport, but they do not accept this either. I can\u2019t figure out how to attach photo to this page, but if I could I would have attached photo of the contract which has specified date and time, together with the photos taken 1 minute after the contract was handed over to me, the photos also have specified date and time (the time on the photo shows swedish time 06:16 and Thailand is 6 hours ahead of sweden so 06:16+6 hours is 12:16.",

Not sure, does not seem harmful but leaves little red marks that itch for a few days.An option to renting a deck chair is to buy your own mat from the mini markets around (cheaper than a day's rental of a deck chair).Grab/tuktuk/taxi fares are relatively high for this part of the world, especially for short rides (e.g. 200Baht for <2km for tuktuk, or 420Baht for Grab).

It\u2019s not as big  as Kata and had the perfect blend of calmness, while still some great restaurants and bars off the main beach road. If travelling during Xmas watch out for venues that put on buffets as they are over priced, food isn\u2019t great and over all not great value for money. Beach was lovely. We stayed in Moveninpick hotel which again was lovely.",

There\u2019s restaurants opposite the beach where we grabbed lunch after which topped the afternoon off perfectly. Highly recommend if you want to go to a beach that\u2019s not overly crowded.

I\u2019ve had a \u2018Damascus Road\u2019 experience.Today I bought a dry bag from the local shop. Stuffed my clothes in the bag and swam the whole length of the beach towing my stuff behind. This is the third day running.It\u2019s a popular venue but there\u2019s enough space to get some quiet. Long white sand which crunches under your feet like the sound of flour or custard being pressed, clear lapping water, water sports, beach massage, cheap food, very little loud music, family friendly... need a say more!And then there\u2019s the sunsets. I think the Creator tripped up when making the sunsets here and left a large dollop of his (or her) glory. Every evening I\u2019ve sat on the sand and been awed by the west facing view of the closing day. It\u2019s a must for your trip, and a free show. First time I saw it there were tears in my eyes.However, be aware of a couple of thingsFirstly the beach road is busy, so kids particularly will need watching.Secondly, the largest proportion of visitor seems to be Russian.They\u2019re friendly enough but it was another significant culture to get the measure of on my holiday. I\u2019ve found myself latching onto every English speaking conversation I can.So. Please don\u2019t tell anyone about this place, we don\u2019t want too many people to share it with us.

The many Russian families with young children bear testimony to the calm, safe conditions that can prevail. We have breakfast early (before 7h30), then head down in the coolness of the morning. As most businesses only open at 9 or 10, the beach, like the village, is very peaceful before 10. Ideal for a beach stroll to the southern end and refreshing dips along the way should you need it.",

Karon beach is fabulous, fine wide sand turquoise water and it is never crowded as it is so long. However the beach chairs are back, In my estimation they were gone for about 3 years, but at the end of August 2018 they were there..

They will give you a card and you will win something, old story.

The beach itself would be beautiful if tidied up,  the rubbish is unbelievable.  We picked up handfuls each time we walked along but the rubbish bins were very few and far between which won\u2019t be helping the situation.  Twice we picked up large chunks of broken glass, if someone had stood on it they would have been in trouble.  We did not swim at the beach due to the mess.  Such a shame the local hotels/resorts and government who are benefitting from tourists dollars don\u2019t pitch in and clean up.  I\u2019d rather pay a little more to stay there if it helped in cleaning up the space, such a beautiful place it seems a waste not to mention the poor sea life!",

Vendors walk around selling ice cream, corn on the cob, beach garb, but are not persistent. Lifeguards on duty. Little fish easily spotted swimming close to where the waves break. Jetskis for hire available, as well as parasailing.Seafood restaurants just across the road, but no halaal options available. Most places serve alcohol, even those listed as halaal.

Only one of them is permanently there and it's not a very high-quality net. The locals were reluctant to let me play, as they should've been because I'm an indoor player :) Don't expect to just jump on the court. Met some other young travelers that I played with too.After playing for a little, I watched the sunset, which was really pretty.There were people flying in the sky harnessed to parachutes, which looked fun. They were anchored in the ground, not being towed by boats. Not sure if this is still called parasailing.",

The sea is clean and warm and there are gentle swells even at high tide. We were able to bob around in the sea for hours on end.We hired loungers and an umbrella every day from one of the vendors who were also very friendly. We got to know the vendor quite well and he was amazing. Every day we would leave our towels and hotel basket at our lounger while we went to lunch. Everything was still there on our return. One day t started raining while we were at lunch and the vendor packed up our belongings and moved them under cover until we returned.We were at Karon out of season so it was not too crowded.

Please however stay at the northern end where the small town is, as the beach is clean there. Unfortunately we took a walk all the way along the beach and half way down, the beach is just full of litter, it's EVERYWHERE and also in the sea. Why can't people take their litter with them or put it in a bin? It's unfortunately ruined half the beach so we turned back to our usual spot in the northern end! I'm assuming they only clean the northern end as it's where the town, and most of the hotels, are. A fun beach with big waves and soft sand, just choose the right end!!",

Let\u2019s just say I probably wouldn\u2019t want to see the busy season.The beach at the Southern and Northern ends has some litter. We stayed in the middle and it was really pretty. Comparable to our beaches in Australia. There\u2019s no surf to speak of, as in, Beach break. Very calm. I\u2019d say the headland would be ok. If you want reasonably relaxing surroundings this is probably your best bet. Patong to the North was hectic as, Kata to the south was a nice beach as well but in my opinion not as nice. My advice is hire a bike, unlike Chiang Mai, things are pretty spread out here and your cheapest Tuk Tuk (which is actually a red cab) but they call it Tuk Tuk, is 200 baht l, a go, starting price. To get anywhere that is more than 1 kilometre starts to add up, like for instance, Patong 400 baht, Kata 300 baht, Phuket 700 baht. If you want a full on night life this is not your place. It is mainly filled with Russians whom the locals say, stay and drink in their hotel rooms mainly. We went out a fair bit and we were it. Karon just down the road is a little busier with a bit more night life.",

When we came it was not over crowded and the few vendors we saw are not overly pushy or aggressive. Para-sailing is available on the beach but most individuals either just sun bathe, walk the beach and or play in the water. A life guard is on duty depending on the section of beach you are on. Just pay attention and you will be fine. Oh yes last but not least  I know my hotel supplied us with Beach Towels I cannot say the same with the other resorts so it\u2019s not a bad idea to pack your own just in case.

The beach itself is long and wide with the water being mostly very calm, due to the bay it sits in. It wasn\u2019t very busy when we were there which was also great. There are lots of restaurants along the beach both at the far end toward Patong, where we stayed and more centrally near Karon town.We stayed at the Novatel, Karon beach which was a very family oriented hotel. It\u2019s across the road from the beach and a short walk into Karon. It\u2019s also a 5-10 minute trip into much busier Patong.There are lots of great restaurants in town. Our favourite was Two Chefs, great food and lovely staff and management( they also make yummy cocktails!!!)You can catch a local bus from the main temple in Karon. For 40 baht it will take you all the way to Old Phuket town, the weekend night markets, Chalong Temple or one of the big shopping malls. A great bargain and a fun way to travel.So, Karon Beach is beautiful, the people are lovely, there\u2019s great food and cheap massages( Apple Massage was my favourite)What\u2019s not to love?

There are massive rivers and streams of poo (not treated) going into the ocean in both ends and that raw material is diluted (not much, unfortunately) in the water you are swimming. BUT, it is the cleanest I could find. It is big, it is almost beautiful, definitely not paradisiac (no such thing in Phuket). The water temperature is fantastic though.If you are going to south Phuket this is the beach to keep you happy, but if you are still undecided if Phuket is a good beach destination, don't go and save yourself from disappointment. Unless you are used to really rubbish beaches, Phuket will not add any value to a beach holiday.",

        "Review": "Karon Beach was very beautiful, but lacks shade other than the 100 baht chairs/umbrellas.  The day we were there a massive rain storm came and lasted for an hour before we packed up and left.  Keep in mind that we are from Seattle and very use to rain...and out waiting it.  There were taxi's easily available at the stand down the main street.  We had several hours here before the rain came in and loved it.  There were A LOT of beach sellers around, but they were easily put off by a polite \"no thank you.\"  This is a vast sandy beach with beautiful green water.  This beach was suggested to us by the tour desk of our hotel in Patong...she said it was one of the cleaner large beaches around, and I would agree.  There was a pretty strong undercurrent that made me nervous for the little kids playing away from their parents, but everyone seemed to be having fun.  I would not have let my 7 year old play alone in this water.  This beach was much nicer than Patong Beach, but Patong was a better place to stay for us-more shops, markets, restaurants etc.  We did not once go in the water at Patong solely based on what it looked like.  And we jumped right into Karon Beach's water.  It cost us 300 Baht to take a taxi from Patong to Karon...and as a side note that taxi turned out to be a karaoke taxi...complete with microphone, flip down video screen, disco light and tamborine... it felt like Cash Cab and made the ride feel like it was not far at all.",

        "Review": "We booked a hotel at Karon Beach that was directly across the street specifically because we wanted easy access to the beach and sea and some of the reviews sounded like it was clear and beautiful. However, after checking into our hotel we crossed the street to the beach and discovered it was filthy (cigarette butts, wrappers and garbage among the trees) and incredibly crowded to the point of being uncomfortable. The water itself appeared clear and the sunset view from the beach is lovely, if you don't mind standing there among a kazillion tourists to watch it.  There were a number of families with children and it seemed like the kids were having a great time in the water though. There are people para-sailing overhead, which was interesting to watch. When you get closer to the water the beach becomes cleaner, but among the trees in the shade and near the beach chairs it is dirty and disheartening.After the initial disappointment, I gave the beach another try in the morning when there were fewer people there. I walked through the garbage-littered trees again and decided to sit down in one of the many rows of now mostly unoccupied beach chairs facing the sea for a few moments. Soon after sitting down, I was accosted by what I was later told was one of  the \"beach mafia\" who was standing there with a rake, not cleaning up the dirty beach but instead harassing me to pay him baht to sit in a chair, even though it is a public beach (directly across from our hotel) and most of the chairs were empty that time of the morning. He yelled and threatened me until I finally got up and left, as I was not going to pay baht to sit among garbage.This is not the beach we imagined from the photos, nor from other reviews here that we have read. You would think they would make more of an effort to keep this beach clean. Sorry we came here; it was the low point of our visit to Thailand.",

The beach is clean, the water is warm and shallow. Some activites as parasailing and jet-ski are offered. Sunbeds and umbrellas can be rented. Moving around, if not walking on the beach, has become expensive as the \"taxi\" and tuktuk organisations fixed the prices and now ask for 200 baht just for a short hop. For me it is now even more important to choose a centrally located hotel, in walking distance of e.g. beach / town / restaurants.",

The town is a good size with plenty of shops, bars, and restaurants to choose from but is not as crazy and chaotic as Patong. However, it is still a close cab ride if you want to head to Patong at night for more action. The beach is beautiful and the water is clam, clear, and warm. Along the beach road there are plenty of shops and restaurants which is perfect. We also visited Patong, Surin and Kamala beach on this trip...all of which are nice. Surin has a beautiful beach, but it lacks the amenities that are found at the other beaches. Patong itself is a zoo...lots and lots of people. Kamala would be a good option to stay as well, but Karon is bigger and you have more options in Karon. Be prepared to be surrounded by Russians. We went in Phuket in March 2018 and Russian is the predominant language you will hear around you (at all beaches). In fact, I didn't hear many other languages being spoken on my trip. Don't worry though, most Thai people speak some level of English at the beach and you should be fine. The menus will be in English, Thai, and many times also in Russian.  If you are worried about language problems, you can buy a SIM card at the airport for your phone so that you have Google translate with you, but it isn't necessary. Overall, I would highly recommend staying at Karon beach...it has everything you need.",

Lots of restaurants and shops across the road and taxi stand at main road too. Still too crowded with people for me, but not as crowded as Patong Beach.",

We're not huge beach goers (prefer pool and shopping when in Phuket) and we did get rain a couple of times.The beach is lovely but the deck chairs (that you hire for 200 Baht, around $4 AUS) aren't as close to the waters edge as you can get in other parts of Phuket (like Kamala).  There are also far fewer food vendors on this beach which reduces the variety on offer.We did love the fireworks and lantern releasing on the beach at sunset/night.",

We read that Karon Beach was less busy and hectic than Kata or the other surrounding beaches, but we still found it really busy. After coming from the chilled, clear blue waters of Khao Lak, this was a real comedown. Thank god we're staying in a gorgeous hotel, or else I would have felt really sad. It doesn't feel like Thailand either. And the constant bothering by local sellers was really annoying. If you want a boozy, busy getaway, great. Otherwise, go to Khao Lak.",

We felt very safe leaving our belongings on the beach while swimming in the ocean.Come to this beach in the evening and you can purchase those lanterns that you light and float into the sky for 100-200 baht, or just watch the ones taking off!",
