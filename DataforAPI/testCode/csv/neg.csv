The Hotel team people Excellent Miss Sumin / The Managers are Great. Cook Mr Rana  daily Served us special Indian Tea. Miss Sumin upgraded  us with Best Suite. The whole family enjoyed the stay.
"Lovely clean beach, just be wary of the beach sellers... you show interest and they are very persistent."
Not the nicest beach in Phuket but it is close to Patong and full of water sport activities.Unfortunately because it is so busy there seems to be a lot of rubbish lying around.Good place to sit hire a lounge and watch the world go by.
"Not for families with little children. Beach far too dirty, surrounding areas full with dodgy massage places, too many drunken people even during the day."
We visited the place at around 10.30am. The place is crowded with tourist.  The beach hour at this our of the day. Restaurants are available near the beach.. You can borrow mat and umbrella for 100 baht. Jetski and para ride are available for around 1500 baht each.
"Patong beach is a lovey beach but very busy during the day with lots of pubs and markets along the opposite side of the road. In the night the famous Bangla road comes to life with hundreds of bars all down one strip is just out of this world I haven’t seen anything like it. There are thousands of people walking the streets in and out of all the bars there are lots of people on the streets trying to selling you light up things, bracelets sunglasses suits Also the famous ping pong shows!! We went down there most nights so think we tackled most the bars we had a fab time and it was a great experience we can’t wait to come back :)"
The parasols and sunloungers have been banned so all the usual things like makeshift bars etc were gone.
"seemed clean plenty of pushing to buy rides beware tho 1500 baht in the am down to 1100 baht in the pm for parasailing so do not over pay, great for a good walk along the whole beach and felt safe there"
"If you enjoy frenetic Asian holiday destinations then you will like Patong Beach.Unruly, dirty and hot it is typical of many similar destinations throughout Asia.Full of bars and bad restaurants not to mention the hassling touts it is probably more for the young or young at heart. It is not what I would consider a family destination as I believe there are better and nicer than Patong Beach.Surprisingly it is very expensive, especially shopping, and bartering has all but disappeared. Food is hit and miss and can be very expensive. The Hard Rock Cafe in Patong Beach is one of the most expensive I have ever experienced.The taxis have formed a collective and now have pretty much fixed prices for most destinations. The minimum fare for a relatively short distance is around USD$7.00 which is expensive for this part of the world.The Thai people in this area are not the friendliest that I have experienced either.Overall an average party destination geared to ripping off tourists."
A great spot to chill out and enjoy the sun and water also to do a bit of shopping whilst your there
"We found the area around the beach to be very filthy and smelling a bit foal, with waste piled up in black bags or just strewn around"
"water was clear great swimming,and a nice few lazy days with great weather"
"pros: easy access, big beach, many beach activities and sportscons: waters not clear, overly crowded, expensive, not quite the ""island beach experience"" one would hope to get when on an island!"
This place is definitely a tourist spot. There so much clubs and restaurants and bars to go to. The beach is not far at all from the happening spot. The night life is also poppin  in this area.
"Patong, the most visited destination in Phuket, is full of life and activities.Hotels, Restaurant, Shops and Bars this place come in it's full once sun gets down.If you like water sports, do visit, water is pretty clean.Beach has few Separate smoking zone & lavetory  to use in case of emergency."
Excellent. Neat and clean beach. Good water sport. Good guide. Good location. Good breezy wind beach.
We went to the beach everyday and despite some bad comments we found it to be clean and pleasant everytime.
A long endless beach jam packed full of tourists. Quite a wild windy and wavy beach. Doesn't seem as pretty and quant as Kata.Patong is more a place for young travellers or old men picking up lady boys. The vibe is pumping and buzzing if that's what u want . The beach has many sellers trying to make a living . Which is fine but can be annoying after the tenth one. There are many Cafes or restaurants to chose from across the road
"awesome time, great for a hot day, awesome surfing and relaxing. this is one of the best beaches in the whole of asia i would recommend to anyone"
Beach located very close to the town happenings and food outlets. Wide range of food in terms of choice & price.Everyone was friendly. Locals and tourists.
Been there 4 times for the past 7 years. It was so much better with chairs and tourist sitting by the beach during my 1st visit. You don't see the crowd that much nowadays. Maybe due to the water sports activities.
Lots of activities and friendly people. Clean and usable and quite kid friendly. The watersports were a hit and everyone enjoyed it but a lot of bargaining is a must. Just opposite the beach are a lot of fast food joints and bargain shopping
"The walk along Patong Beach is excellent especially on weekends when the night market comes alive and you can get all sorts of food , souvenirs ,  gifts at reasonable prices , a bit of haggling required but already the prices are quite reasonable .We were there on the New Years Eve night and could not have been at a better place .So much activity going on you can spend hours just sitting and watching , lantern lighting was unique and thoroughly enjoyed it ! A must visit and as mentioned excellent on weekends after dark !"
The beach was across the road from our hotel.Really nice beach with space for all and water sports available.Flags out for safety but look out for the paragliders coming down constantly.Nice sand and flat areas all along for ball games.The usual watch and sunglasses sellers walking about trying to make a living.We did buy some sunglasses very cheap which were fine but we did barter down by a very large amount so really surprised how lttle the actually cost.The water was shallow but a bit choppy at times as was wet and windy some days during our stay.On the sunny days it had a nice breeze to keep you coolNot as picturesque as Krabi beach but still very relaxing.
"Water is ok there because there r too much boats,Kathu and Karen beaches are much much bettter,here you can have kind of average swim"
Paring beach is nice with a long coastline. Lots of local Thai and tourist enjoyed themselves there with various water sports. Must visit
"I will not recommend you the Patong Beach for swim. Moreover fun at nights at Patong beach may not be ok for everbody. Lots of bars, restaurants, gogo bars (erotic show bars) and hundreds of people. If you are looking for romantizm, you are at the wrong place. It is better for alone men."
My wife and I visited Patong Beach during the evening hours during our honeymoon and we had a blast. We stayed in the nice quite resort of The Shore and visited Patong Beach to enjoy the night life. It's like being in Las Vegas as people are all over walking the streets and having fun. There are bars all over and Ping Pong Shows galore (beware lol). It's a great time just make sure you bring as much Thai baht as you are willing to spend so your credit card doesn't go over its limit.
"A nice soft sand clear watered beach, full of varieties of holidaymakers. nice for a relaxing stroll or sunning yourself, only thing that ruined it for me was people pestering me to buy things every 10 mins it takes away the tranquillity of the experience but other than that its a great beach, its clean and stunning on the eye definitely the best attraction in Patong."
"Not the best since its crowded and has litter, the beach but worth a visit since its smack in the centre of patong. you can walk along the beach as you make your way to bangla street for clubing in the evening. You can chose from a variety of water sports."
"Good beach and can find spaces away from people. Water little murky but has lifeguards and is in great location for quick access to street food, shops and markets."
"Patong Beach apparently is the most visited beach in phuket and so most hotels are also nearby. there is nothing too extraordinary about it, just the usual activities and not many shacks(I visited during the month of june). Right outside the beach is the patong market which is nice with a variety of things to offer."
"I was a little nervous about the beach because I had heard that it wasn't the prettiest and always overcrowded. But when I got there I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely wasn't over crowded there was plenty of room and people didn't look like there were sitting on top of each other. It was clean despite be such a popular destination and even though they say its not the pretty the views was beautiful and water just perfect. There are a few places to get food from on the beach side and locals doing massages, hair braiding etc. Overall I enjoyed my day at the beach :)"
"It's probably not the nicest beach, but it's the closest to Patong, if you don't have a car, and don't want to spend money for the taxi. Go there in the morning, it's more comfortable and you avoid the crowded! The water is not perfectly clear, but still nice, and it's perfect for young kids :)"
"The beach walk is nice, easy.  Didn't like the actual beach though.  Lots of restaurants and market stalls along the beach walk.  The stall holders don't hassle you too much either which is great.   Worth just taking a stroll down."
"Nice beach, but very comon to tourists, so a lot of dirt amd trash are laying around there.I’ve had a better time at other beach around there such as Tri Trang Beach"
"It was great weather in December though we had sharp showers once during our stay. Nice beach, nice view - there was big cruise liner anchored nearby. Good to laze around with a beers....."
"Nothing special. Like many places in Thailand, it is overpriced, overrated and underdeveloped. It is also a bit dirty."
Great beach for those who don't have the time to travel much further or for those who are not adventurous to venture out further. Too many people and skillets and boats that ruins the whole atmosphere of a holiday. Great for younger people i guess.
"We enjoyed the beach and the water temperature...went jet skiing and had a ball.  We found that there was less hassle at the southern end of the beach where we could access everything we needed, get to know the locals and enjoy our time..."
"I have been living in Patong for quite some time now and still in love with it like the first day. Its a place that has everything from beach to hills to club restaurants and nightlife. You can easily find quite places too if you dont like chaos just avoid a couple of places like Bang la road and thats all. The beach is clean the people are nice and most speak English decently. There are fantastic resprts like the Emerald Terrace Condo where I live and a variety if things to do. Also very close to the airport and well connected to the rest of the island, in maximum half an hour by car you reach anything you want. Best place in Phuket in my opinion!"
"Its a nice, comparatively clean beach. We enjoyed our bath. Umbrella/beach bed was quiet affordable."
"This is a cool beach with great beach activities eg ski boats, parasailing. Rent out umbrella and chairs for THB100. Drinks also available on the beach."
"Been to Patong beach only one day, i was doing my tour of checking all of phuket's beaches. The beach is way too overcrowded, can't swim without being bothered by boats going back and forth pretty close to the shore."
Amazing time! Beautiful sea and the beach. Many resorts and hotels nearly the beach. Also you can buy cold drinks or beer. Cheap food and taste. Lots of little shops with souvenires. I was there on Festival Water and Thai new year. Wow! Never forget
This beach is good if not compared with Maya Bay/Bamboo Islands.Paragliding is very expensive covering less than 5 minutes!
"Thailands Phuket was a great place to go particularly if you are an experienced Motor Scooter operator.  Driving around or taxiing is not good because it gets too congested and parking is a problem. The beaches and dining establishments were teaming with Europeans, especially people from Germany in December/January.  The Thai people are very friendly and courteous and they seem to be on the rise even though they recently had a Coup and the ruling military are in charge.  Thailand has the very best massage parlors anywhere at the lowest prices and very experienced in this craft.  I highly recommend foot massages and whole body to relax and enjoy throughout your stay.  It cost something like $12 US for 2 hours of highly skilled massage."
"On our first day, we couldn't believe the rubbish coming in with the tide. swimming between the plastic bags was a horrible experience. Next few days we took a taxi to Surin beach, which is great.However afterthat we tried Patong again, very little rubbish, and the beach looked great in the sunshine. Give it a try."
"Relax on the beach, watch a perfect sunrise or sunset whilst having a relaxing massage. The water is absolutely divine"
This beach is a little bit too busy if you are looking for a relaxing break .Personally speaking i wouldn't trust the guys renting out the jet ski's.Would recommend karon or surin beaches which are both only 15/20 mins away.
Patong Beach- Bangla Road is exciting and fun for everyone. Great vibe along the street and entertainment caters to all interests.
"Expensive crowded, dirty beach, unfriendly (sellers) people who want just take the money from the tourists to do nothing .  I live in Thailand already  17 years  and visited  Patong beach before many times.  The time is here now,,, never  ever back again. Many other beautiful  places to spend my time and my money without  stress."
"Lots of activities that you can do there... can lie on a mat to chill and read a book, get a massage by the beach... do note that its an open area though. Sea related activities available as well... parasailing, jetski, etc etc.... it can be scorching hot during the midday and afternoon... so come with lots of sunscreen..."
"great for fun with friends beautiful girls highly recommended, short or long holiday remains a place to visit"
"Everything is very close restaurants ,I've never been to other beaches near patong beach. patong beach is nice because there are many clubs and bars around"
This beach was a little dirtier on the side we were on. If you are interested in doing some water activities then this is definitely great for that but we found after being on the beach one day we had a lot of bug bites on our legs and decided not to return.
if one price is two expensive the next one will not be just keep walking they come out of the woodwork when they know you have dollars
"Good place if you are a water sports  lover. you can enjoy para- sailing , water scooter , surfing or a speed boat ride. Rates are quite competitive but do not forget to bargain else you will end up paying more. Don't go by the rate chart..."
A beach with a lot of tourist and sea activities. Prices are around 2500 baht and above for the activities and will recommend for those who rarely been to beach before. Not really crowded as the beach is huge and a lot of food there as well.
"Ok, there were too many beach beds but who had the bright idea to get rid of them all? We liked to have beach beds....please put them back !"
"Beautiful beach spoilt by so many tourists.The whole place is like a Russian enclave full of touts and hawkers,there are many better beaches just a few miles away."
we stayed in kata beach and visited other beaches as well as Patong and were very pleased that we didn't stay there. We were looking for a peace and quiet but Patong was a mess!! Those that are single and looking for action 24/7 maybe is a perfect place
"over the last 11 years we have made patong our family holiday destination, the first hotel was the comfort inn resort, at $35 a night, 3star (now the Burasari hotel)so we found the Baan sukhotai resort and spa on bangala rd,at $45 a night now the tiger bar? so we have spent the last few years at the millennium patong resort, and love it, 4 and a half star first year $80 a night . 2014 $119 a night , 2015 tried centra hotel $90 a night, went to book millennium for 2016 $219 a night our family consists of 4-6 adults and 3 children, 2-3 rooms for a minimum stay 14 nights. so patong beach is off my holiday list."
"Really busy atmosphere, locals kept asking if we would want to see ping pong/sexy show walking through which was off putting"
Unlike other comments we found the beach to be clean and pleasant. It was a bit busy but not overcrowded as other reviewers commented.
The beach is actually not as pretty as others. It is the nearest to the town but there is nothing much to offer.
We paid for lounge chairs nearly every day it was so so relaxing. The water on the first day was nice but a storm rolled through and the water was littered with rubbish after that so didn’t swim but was still so relaxing down there and the breeze was nice
"Patong Beach is close to many hotels and the party area.  We stayed at a resort in Patong and checked this beach out.  It's not bad per se, but there are so many better beaches around Phuket.  We hated being asked to buy stuff every 5 minutes (wish I was exaggerating).  Hard to relax in that environment.  We opted to visit other beaches for the remainder of our vacation."
"I like patong beach , it holds great memory for me in sense of nature & relaxation ,, there are lots of activities provided there and u will have great time ,, this beach had one of the best sunset I ever seen ( photos attached )"
"The beach is long and clean. In February 2020 it was comfortable - not many people, but it wad due to virus - Chnese did noit come."
"the main street is full of bars and clubs, promoters pestering you left and right and there was no exception to the rule every time i walked to my accommodation through the area having ping pong show menu showed in your face not once or twice....Beach was okay itself but the 'retailers' bothered you every 5 minutes regardless the fact i had earphones in or pretended to be asleep. I'd pay for a spot on exclusion zone just to have some peace.Place is clearly for heavy partiers and sex tourists."
"Full of people that want to lure you in to sex shows. do not bring children, even for adults this was too much. This can be kept away from the streets."
beach and town horrible smells and dirty!!I do not understand people who are happy here! I do not want to come back here !! not recommended!!poof
"These beach is dirty and a bit choppy, along with annoying hagglers and rubbish along it. For a decent beach get out of patong and go to surin or paradise beach."
"I've been to Patong three times now, so I guess I'm asking myself this question. Last time I was there I stayed in the Amari hotel on the hill, and this was fine although the rooms themselves were nothing special. This time I stayed at a mid- to low-range hotel called Coconut Village--truly nothing special. The beach itself is dirty and crowded, the town even dirtier and more crowded. This is not a place you want to spend your holiday unless you are 20 years old and plan to stay up all night dancing and drinking. If you are this type of tourist, could you please not throw your rubbish all over the beach?"
"Patong beach was a rather unpleasant experience. We were rudely hustled and harrassed by the many beach sports vendors asking if we would like to rent their jetskis, etc....often having them rudely address us as ""Oi!""....we could not enjoy any peaceful beachside stroll. The straw that broke the camel's back was when we agreed to an hour's oil massage for THB300 per pax, but only received less than 30 mins of service instead of the promised 1 hour. The only oil used was on our legs, and not the entire body as one would expect. The massage was performed by a rather sulky, unpleasant woman who was rather slipshod, unprofessional, and provided the worst quality massage we had ever experienced. We argued about the service time, but she changed her tune from what we agreed upon. It was a complete rip-off and a scam....do not ever fall for it. Avoid all Patong beach massage providers (i.e. done by the sea, on the sand) like the plague. We vowed never to return to Patong Beach. Horrible experience, horrible vendors."
Went to try it out stayed 1 hour no more had to get away to many russians what have the thia's done was there 5 years ago much better then
"No overcrowding here, but the harassment from the peddlers is an absolute joke.Harassed by vendors selling sunglasses while I was wearing a pair........The water is nice, but loads of trash in the water that tangles around your feet.Go north to other beaches if you can"
"No good especially if you're after a relaxing holiday. Constant harrassment from touts for stupid toys, fruit, massages, overpriced thai boxing etc. Literally, every minute. If not that, ""you want jet-ski?"" No! I want to lay here and sunbathe in peace! No chance of that.The water's hygeine in questionable too. Go to Rawaii beach instead!"
"Whisky the beach itself is nice like most in Thailand I personally found this one way too crowded. If you like some personal space and peace n quiet then this place is not for you. As you can imagine there are 100's of bars, nightclubs, massage shops and restaurants. Probably better for younger people travelling in groups looking for fun excitement and partying. There's even massage available on the beach! If your into that then this place is for you. As they say ""horses for courses"". 2 stars only because this is not my type of place."
"My plan was to check out the Banzaan market, walk through the mall and then hang out at the beach until the sun went down.  Once the sun set I wanted to explore Bangla road, have a few drinks and maybe even see a ""show"".  But, the Banzaan market smelled horrible, there was no way we could eat there.  The mall was nice, air conditioned, clean, some nice shops and places to eat.  We had sushi outside at the SushiBox.  It wasn't as fresh as we anticipated...we didn't finish our food.  We walked in the heat to the beach from the mall...very very hot and dirty smelly roads.  There are so many solicitors and they are a bit pushy.  Bangla road is just a bunch of bars...bars on bars on bars.  We didn't stay very long because I imagine it's not a safe area at night and there are probably drunks everywhere.  We couldn't wait to get back to Kata Noi where it's safe and clean.  I realize most of the shops, restaurants and food stands are the same so I would recommend checking out Kata beach for cleaner bars, restaurants and food stands.  It feels much safer in Kata and it doesn't smell like sewage."
"I was here yesterday, and from the minute we stepped onto the foreshore we were hassled by people trying to sell us things, massages, food, seats, water activities. When we got to the water line, there was rubbish everywhere, I greatly appreciated that we had agreed not to swim as I hate to think what we would have caught. Those brace enough to enter the water. I salute you. I think this beach would be okay if you only wanted to sun bath, but I would be hesitant to swim in it. The water sports looked fun but unorganised. Again, personal choice. I wouldn't bring little children here.Nice view though."
Jet ski on patong is owned by local mafias there. They will provide you jet ski at very cheap rate whatever you offer them but thats a trap. If u get a scratch on jet ski or anything happens they will charge you 100000 bath to 600000 bath. This happened with many people there. They take sign from us before we take.  Apart from all these its very dangerous to do jet ski on that beach. I was with my other 3 friend we hired 2 jet ski and one jet ski got turned in the water and we were drowning .. Those guys from whom we hired they were watching us but did not came to help usIts a big storyAll i can say is its super risky there beware.     Please do not go for jet ski there ... There are many other places to do .. Its a wavy beach its not safe to jet ski there .. Its matter about life and death .. We got escaped.  Everyones not lucky
"I was so disappointed when ı saw that beach,it was too crowded to relax, too many day beds were placed. ıt is a place just for he people who wants to have fun next to beach that's all.."
"Have seen better beaches a lot, the beach is hyped possibly for the town and its nightlife! I understand my visiting time was in off season when its not safe to swim, but the water did not seem very clean, quite murky if you like, and there was rubbish litter everywhere.It was red flag all the time and no one was around on the life guard posts.Overall, you would not miss anything if you skip this!"
"I have travelled along the cost i.e. Patong, Kalim, Kamala, Surin, Bang Tao, Karon, Kata, every beach was dirty with rubbish... plastic bottles, cigarette butts & general junk.In my three week stay I never saw anyone cleaning the beaches, this place is advertised a Beach Paradise!!! take a good look at yourself Phuket the tourist will look for another Paradise"
"I visited 10 years ago and really enjoyed Patong, however this paradise beach has deteriorated into a cesspool of rubbish.We went for a swim, as quickly as we eagerly entered the water, we existed as myself and three kids were covered in rubbish.Not a nice experience."
"It's time to make people aware of the dangers of swimming in the waters of Patong Beach.  The infrastructure was only built to sustain a small fishing village of 5000 people, not a hundred thousand.  All the waste is overflowing into the waters people swim in.  The local government has even reported november of 2013, the pollution levels in the water are now at dangerous levels. Think about that when you swim there."
The worst beach in thailand I have been to. It is too crowded. Lots of touts and fraud here and there. dirty and very small.
"over crowded, full of people trying to sell you rubbish… backpackers everywhere. Much better beaches"
"Its to far from all the islands. 45 min to the marina and then the boat rides are and hour. The smell when you go over the sewage is gross. Nothing to see here. Krabi was much easier. Rented a private motor boat for 10000 Bhat, was at Phi Phi, and bamboo beach in 45 min right from the beach."
"Spent a couple of hours on our first day here - the sea was dirty and murky, rubbish floating and tangling in my feet, I got out quickly. Unable to relax due to being asked to buy something every 5 minutes. The beach is full of jet ski's and speed boats which charge an astonishing amount for short rides. We spent the rest of our time in Patong by the pool in our hotel before going on to a quieter, cleaner part of Thailand. A very different (and disappointing) place to what we visited just over 9 years ago."
"Patong is famous for its nightlife, not its beach. Nevertheless, one would probably saunter along the beach when he/she is at Patong as it is located just in front of one of the most bustling parts of the town. Really nothing much about the beach and it is quite crowded. The sand is not the most pristine and the water is not the clearest. Just be sure you do not sit on the folding beach chairs arranged along the beach as you would soon find someone asking for payment from you."
This is first scam  only taxi can take you from bus station  to patong. Costing 450  baht it is 20 min drive . In general patong has become full of girl bars and massage  places. Traffic is very dangerous not for kids
"Dont go to Pstong unless your under 30. Party town, too many people. No longer a relaxing place to be for a holiday unless you are into drinking and eating. Visited this place before sunami and again in May 2016. Seems just another busy city nowadays. The beach has little shade from hot sun. Few and far between of hiring shaded sunbeds on beach unless prepared to haggle"
"Unfortunately this us no longer paradise. At high tide it is almost impossible to find anywhere to lay a towel and sunbath. The loungers have taken over, which is fine if you want to spend 150BHT and spend the day. Just when you think you've found somewhere, the para sale guys set up and blow whistles to get you moving. Continuous hassling by hawkers make this a fairly average day at the beach. Further south at Kata the water is clearer and less crowded. Have a bit of a look around Phuket, there's better beaches."
"I'd skip Patong totally on future visits to Phuket. 3 days there was two and half too many. It seems though self interests rule. Eg: A mafia runs transportation and screws people at every chance. Not a little. But hugely. The government would have to have a hand in this or it wouldn't happen this widely. 400 baht for a short tuk tuk. Seriously!It's not just the money. No one wants to be screwed every time they walk out the door. Leaves you in a bad mood on holidaysAnd like the shirt says.  ""No I don't want a f..ing massage or suit"". I should not have to answer this 300 times a day. No exaggeration.""  Funny thing is I probably would have had a massage if it wasn't for the annoying sales robots that stalk you. They are all the same and keep talking for some reason when you say no thanks.  It makes sense the city is going broke. The sooner the dodgy businesses close the better. There are a selected few good ones I came across (my hotel and gym) but generally the city will be better to visit after it goes out of business. Atleast you'd get some peace on the beach."
"We visited Patong beach last week and couldn't wait to get back to Karon.  Patong is way to busy, smelly and the beach locals are pushy at trying to sell you anything...."
lot of dirty stuff flowing into the sea just around the corner from the beach. The beach is busy and you have to cross the road to get there with no pedestrian safe crossing anywhere
There are far better beaches in Phuket than this dump. All you get is harassed and annoyed by touts and scammers. Not a place to go and relax with the family. Give it a miss and go elsewhere
"On arrival our friends brought us to the tourist beach area. It smelled sewers, there was garbage all over the place and we were harassed by vendors.then you have the bars where protitutes and traverts almost outnumber the tourists. We expected beautiful things in Thailand and we realised our friends who had convinced us to spend a month there, definetly were seeking different things. We were glad to get out of that tourist zoo where old white men get hooked up with teenager girls."
"too noisy, too many jet ski's, too many people and hard to walk or swim on the beach. There was rubbish everywhere and the water was horrible with plastic bags and floating debris. Why would anyone want to go to this place?"
when you picture thai beaches you think crystal clear water and white sand - well patong is definitely not that kind of beach its dirty and crowded . - better go to phi phi if you want clean beaches
"Patong is so overrated it makes me sick. It’s crowded, dirty and seedy with all the jet ski and parasailing operators vying for business. The water also looks dirty. I don’t see what the appeal is. Beaches in Australia are a 1000 times  better."
"The area was filled with tourist - but the area seemed dirty, trashy and not really our scene at all. Kind of disappointed."
"I have been to many beaches all over Thailand and loved them all. It pains me to say that I was unimpressed with Patong beach. It is very dirty, smells like sewage and has garbage everywhere. It is sad the toursits have destroyed a beach that used to be so much nicer a few decades ago. I would spend the time travelling 10 minutes in either direction to freedom beach, Kamala, or Karon if you are looking for more of a cleaner and relaxed beach. But if you want a beach and need convenience as this is near Bangla road, the Jungceyleon shopping, and Patong hotels, then stick with this and stay in the middle of the beach, it is the cleanest part because locals have chaise loungers you can rent so they rake up garbage within a 5 foot radius of the equipment they rent, so at least that section is not too bad"
"This place is really good if your idea of fun is drinking a lot of alcohol on a beach. It is not for families. The water is not clean, and there are too many people. Many better beaches in Phuket. The only positive is the small market there where the clothes are of reasonable quality at low prices. However, the tourists are even trying to destroy this. One Chinese guy tried to negotiate a t-shirt from 150 baht down to 100 baht. He even tried to pay 100 after he had been refused. Who told the tourists that you have to also negotiate? In a different store an Australian women tried to negotiate from 200 down to 150 by saying (150 baht, cash, now). This might work with buying something very expensive in Australia, but here, everything is in cash, payable now. Then one guy from Eastern Europe after failing to negotiate threw a tantrum and shouting ""no! no!"" at the poor seller. Guys, let the locals make 50 baht profit. They need the money more than you. The locals on the beach have a very low opinion of Westerners, and after spending 1 hour here, I think this reputation is well deserved. They also have some sea activities, including one where people are strapped to a parachute type device and pulled by a jet ski. The cost is 1500 baht per adult. I timed the length of the ride at 1 minute and 42 seconds from take off to landing. You can make up your own mind about the value for money. Avoid this place"
"...and I have been to A LOT of beaches all around the world. Patong Beach is not only overrun with tourists, but also with people practically assaulting you to try and get you to buy something from them. There is trash of every kind you possibly can think of EVERYWHERE on the beach. I didn't feel safe or comfortable walking around without my shoes on. Gross."
"Phuket was the first stop on a cruise which began in Singapore.  All the photos you see of Phuket, show stunning scenery, interesting history and beautiful beaches.  We arrived at Patong Beach, described by our local guide on our pre-arranged tour as ‘The most beautiful, famous and popular beach on Phuket’. If you could see past the many piles of rubbish that littered both around the beach and along the frontage of the beach then maybe it could be beautiful.  The first stop on our tour was ‘The big Buddha’ situated on top of a mountain overlooking wonderful scenery.  This is a fairly new tourist attraction and work around it is still going on but it is a wonderful place.  However, along much of the road, rubbish is ignored by the locals but definitely noticed by visitors.   Alongside most roads piles of rubbish which had clearly been there a very long time influenced our opinion of the Phuket and I know some might say that it ‘part of the charm’. But to most of us this spoils it for future visits.  The guide was trying to encourage us to promote the area to others but I would not go again."
"Recent trip to patong and went to beach for a swim. Water was brackish which maybe caused by time of year but too many floating things like plastic, paper. Needs a good cleanup.If your seeking a good swim and time in the water get a lift to karong beach which is magic and only a short trip from patong. Much more relaxed."
"If you like tourist bars, constant touting for massages and taxis, repetitive tourist trinket shops all selling the same thing, then go here. If you want a beach full of overpriced pay-for umbrellas and cigarette butts, with the constant droning of jetskis out on the water, go here. If you want to walk down Bangla Rd and not be able to walk five metres without being approached to see a ""ping pong"" show or buy a fake watch, go here.On the other hand, if you want a picturesque beach, a good look at the wonderful Thai culture and people, a chance to wind down and see what this part of the world has to offer, then go somewhere, anywhere other than here."
Dirry filthy beach with hawkers selling anything and everything.  They don't take no for an answer.  Even when you refuse they still hound you to buy crap.
"This is not for families.  I am very open minded, and definitely not a prude, but I did not want to see girls/lady boys dancing on bar counters or see them shooting ping pong balls out of their nether regions!  But the worst part was having people sticking pieces of paper in my face telling me what I could go in and see. Very noisy, definitely a party animal place, but not for me.  But for the young, who want to part with their money and drink lots of booze, I should imagine it was a fun place.  Personally, I couldn't wait to get out of there."
"lovely for an evening stroll, much cooler and enjoyable. Vendors offer everything from tours, fruit, clothing, massages, ski boats etc. u can even have ur hair nd nails done!"
"Patong is a west coast facing beach, can be very rough and has a lot of rubbish on it. Suggest you try beaches on the east side of the island."
"It was our first time to Phuket. We read about Patong which described as a resort town and it was why we just booked our holiday without a in-depth research.We wanted a relaxing and stress free holiday and away from our stressful jobs and we realised we made a wrong decision the minute after arriving in Patong (actually the minute when we stepped outside the airport). The worst bit was the harassment -- on very single road, every corner and on the beach, every 2 seconds, ""Taxi? Tuk tuk? Massage? Jet ski? Parachute? Drugs? Suits? Tattoos? Food?"" Some were even aggressive.The beach is not particularly clean. The sea can be rough to swim in. Definitely not for children. (Basically the whole Patong is not for children!) For people who love drinking, overpriced but average Thai food, parties, dodgy massage, go go bars. Patong Beach and surrounding areas are perfect. Otherwise, please stay away!"
"Quick visit to see if I could have my engagement ring assessed after friends had jewellery made by him in August and highly recommended his work. P C Jewellery of integrity near the beach who said it was old style (yes 39 years in fact) and still solid and he recommended leaving it as it was. I was impressed cause he could have ripped me off. I thanked him for his honest assessment. Had a smoothie at a kiosk then a brief walk on the beach as we passed hawkers offering services, oppressive atmosphere. Couldn't get back to the quieter pace of the Thalang district and our private villa quick enough!"
"Then step onto Patong beach.Would you like a suit, a taxi, a massage, a tuk tuk, a moped, English breakfast, to buy a wallet, maybe some fake diamonds in a cigarette packet, a hat, ice cream, a taxi, a taxi, a taxi......anyway you get the idea.Looking for somewhere quiet and relaxing? Then avoid Patong like the plague. It really is Brits abroad in the truest sense, like Ayia Napa or Ibiza of the East. Head straight on past to Nai Harn, you will not be disappointed."
"Sadly the tourism is basically limited to trashiness. If that is what you want then go - you will have heaps of opportunities to see “f ing show”. Sadly, there isn’t much else to see."
"Never did go during day time, because I lost interest of going there after a early night visit and walked along the beach for around 15 mins, it was nice and dark, but too much trash.........."
"You can't really see the beach for the loungers,umbrellas and street hawkers.Its noisy and overcrowded.The areas to swim are limited to cordoned off areas to prevent collisions between swimmers, jet skiers. para gliders and 'banana' boat riders.Not sure how other reviewers can rate the beach and cleanliness of the sea so highly having seen and smelt the surrounding streets.I certainly wouldn't go for a swim here having seen what's on the streets of Patong and the smell coming up from the sewers and storm drains that flow directly into the sea.Just to look is free but it'll cost you if you want a lounger and umbrella.Patong town - too crowded, too many hawkers - ended up not buying anything as I just couldn't be bothered with the hassle. Its a place of bars and clubs. If you come here to get drunk cheap then this is the place. Can't understand why parents have brought children here.The new mall is an oasis of calm and cleanliness in an otherwise overdeveloped town."
"Patong beach was a great place 5-6 years ago. Now the beach is dirty, over crowded and far too many pushy beach sellers. The Tuk Tuks are a menace, very pushy and aggressive. By mid afternoon many are drinking or worse so use them at your own risk and be prepared to be over charged then threatened if you dont pay. The bars are now only a shade of what they were as many Soi's have closed and the ones that are left are very quiet. The town is full of Russians who walk around as if they own the place. Well they almost do as all the Europeans, Aussies and Americians have left for a better time to Kata and Karon to the south.However Kata and Karon just down the road are busy with great resturants, nice beaches and bars."
"Be careful walking around Patong  Beach streets.  You will be approached by men on bikes, asking if you are from Australia, and start chatting.  You think it is a Thai local just being friendly.  Next minute they are showing you a scratchie and then telling you you have won a major prize and try and get you to go in a taxi to a hotel. This is just a scam to get you there to try and sign you up for Vacation Clubs.   There are several of these companies and it will cost you plenty.  Just walk away and tell them you are not interested.   They use backpackers to approach you.  They are quite persistent, but be firm.  Will save you a lot of money and stress by refusing them."
"When I reached the beach I thought I was going to dye. The sea is brown, the beach is dirty. If you're looking for blue sea, find somewhere else. You can go to Paradise beach o freedom beach. In the night, there's a pedestrian street where you can find prostitutes from all over the world, live sex shows, go go bars... Not a family walk, just to put it simple. Prices are OK. I wouldn't recommend it."
"This is a very average beach to be honest, even when compared to mediocre Australian beaches. Water is murky, there is an open sewer on one end, to many sellers trying to push chair rental, massages or else. Overall please visit but don't consider it the best, there are much better beaches both in Phuket and Australia."
"Patong is like being in some hell dimension. Seriously, I dont understand why anyone would want to go here unless they are into heavy drinking and the vices of Bangla Rd.Patong has:- dirty, rubbish filled beach with tar- the beach has so many rips in it no Australian would EVER go swimming  here! Super dangerous.- the beach Rd. is a cacophony of sound- people constantly annoying the hell out of you maybe for their enjoyment asking for Tuk, Tuk, Taxi, I make suit for you, I have some shoes and dont forget massaaaaaaze!  Again, and again and again...- people constantly trying to rip you off- cars going down the road constantly advertising some Thai boxing on a megaphone- rubbish and stench or sewerage- dark jumpled sizzling powerlinesI could go onI dont understand why anyone would go here, there are so many places in the world."
"Ugh, we stayed here for 4 days. On the 4th day we escaped to Ao Sane beach, because the smell, the vendors every 10', every restaurant asking you to come in. The smell is the worst. You can't walk on a block in any direction and not smell that disgusting smell that permeates everything. I can't imagine what a party town this is as all the bars are empty except for the pretty girl boys trying to intice you to come in & sit down for a beer for 80 baht. Stay away. Any other beach would be better than this one."
