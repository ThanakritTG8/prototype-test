3147113,"Lovely golden sand, clear water,,,,a nice stroll with our dog in the evening...alot of businessees close by are closed unfortunately, but we hoping this will change soon",5, June 2020
3147115,Well today was a nice day for a change and as the rain had stopped I decided to go down to Karon beach .It was nice to see the beach in its natural glory.As currently you can not enter the beach,5, January 2018
3147116,"One of the longest and widest beach on these parts, gentle sloping and usually crowded during Peak season as there's quite a line 4 to 5 stars hotels lining the beach. Though being a long beach, there's usually room for all. Low season this beach sees the largest waves, thus attracting some surfers. There used to be a surf competition every August. Swimmers might want to take note this is quite a dangerous beach during low season and usually there's a warning red flag. Great for walks or simply chill on the beach",4, March 2020
3147122,March good time to go as seawater not too rough.Water is beautiful & warm.100baht for bed & umbrella well needed in 32-36 temp.Drinks available on beach.,5, March 2020
3147123,The big question when you visit Phuket is... Patong beach or Karon beach? Personally I prefered Karon - it has such a lovely long stretch of sand with palm trees across it and is generally quieter. Sunbeds are 200 baht for a day (including 2 adjacent sunbeds with an umbrella).,5, March 2020
3147125,i love this beach... its so wide...its good for jogging..more than 3kilometer long. and water is good also,5, March 2020
3147127,"Excellent beach, very quiet and plenty of space between visitors.The sand is very soft and the water is very clean",5, March 2020
3147135,"visit almost south end of the beach, they had little bar an sunbeds for rent there. great service at bar. Too hot to stay more than two ours",4, March 2020
3147136,u can see this beach while visiting Karon viewpoint. good one. clean and well maintained. i visited in during the sun set time.,4, June 2019
3147137,Very beautiful resort. Located on beach near a cove. You can snorkel right off the beach. The restaurant have great food with different varieties. The pool area has options for couples only or with kids with slides and lazy river. I had ordered a private dinner on the beach right at sunset. It was an amazing experience. Our server Dear made it even more pleasant and memorable. We had a blast at this hotel. We definitely will be back. Thank you much!,5, March 2020
3147139,"Would recommend Karon Beach instead of Patong Beach if you enjoy the beach and not the bars.Even though it's a lot quieter you can still sit at our bar, listen to a band and have a few drinks.",4, March 2020
3147140,"A long beach with not a lot of shade, except back from the sand itself, it is a very pleasant place. Lots of restaurants, bars and shopping nearby, easy to get a taxi, tuk tuk or local bus service (try it!) to Patong or Phuket city from here. When we were here in January 2020 it was packed with Chinese, but mainly Russian tourists. No doubt that has all changed with corona virus. I'm sure there will be many bargains to get tourists back when this finally blows over. It is just such a tragedy that the locals here were only just getting over the 2004 tsunami to be only hit by something almost as devastating all these years later.",4, January 2020
3147143,"You can rent beach chairs which come with an umbrella. Beautiful views, warm blue ocean. Just be prepared for very hot sand froom noon to mid-afternoon. Jetski packages available at the beach",5, March 2020
3147144,"Prefer Karon than patong on the crowds, noise and night life. Morning was nice stroll family friendly and safe. Afternoon gets busy with people sunbath and volleyball plus other water activities. There are shops and restaurants alongside the beach for quick bite and drinks for those who wants to cool down the heat.",5, December 2019
3147145,"This beach is beautiful, clean and safe. When it is not they will fly flags. Also not constantly annoyed by beach sellers, they come show what they have to sell but don't bother you",5, March 2020
3147151,Lots of activities. Many places to eat and drink in the vicinity. Availability of water sports  on the beach . Can spend the entire day and good for walks also.,4, October 2019
3147154,"A lovely beach which is absolutely packed, loads of nearby places to eat and drink. Water sports available.",4, March 2020
3147156,"We didn't stay in Karon town, but we came to this beach 4 times over two weeks.  The sand and water here was the best on this coastline area south of Patong.  Very very clean.  The only better beaches we found we on islands off the coast - Similan being our favourite and then Khai islands beaches second.  Karon would be third - but the most convenient to get too.  Lots available here if you want it - jet skis, parasailing - lots of food just off the beach - plenty of little shops if you need to take a break from the beach for an hour.",5, March 2020
3147157,While the beach is nice and good to walk on especially early morning do be careful if you want to go into the sea. There is a rip tide which can sweep you out to sea. There are several warning about this on the beach and also telling you what to do if you get caught in one so do read the instructions before going into the sea.,3, March 2020
3147158,"We were on holiday with my family in Karon and frequently visited the beach. All sports of activities were available to soend the whole day there. Sunbeds also are available for 200bht for whole day. Eating is easy to arrange just across the road. Beach is clean and well maintained, not toi much disturbance - just relaxin.",4, February 2020
3147161,"Tranquil place. Clean, with umbrellas/ beds available at 200 bhat per day. Some massage food/drinks shacks. Rows of restaurants on the opposite side of the road and shops/small market too to get essentials",4, March 2020
3147162,"The beach in Karon is beautiful in many ways. Clean, tidy and very sandy. The beach is wide so there is plenty of room to lay out a couple of towels if you don't want to hire a sunbed and parasol. The sea is lovely and warm but has a very strong under-currant so beware going out too far. A distinct lack of any toilets of any kind but that seems to be the case on a lot of beaches outside of Europe or the USA. No facilities for washing sand off of your feet etc. A little investment in these facilities would make life a whole lot better for foreign visitors that maybe used to them being in place. The sunsets here are beautiful  don't forget your camera. Overall the beach is fabulous.The main street in Karon is a very vibrant place with lots of bars and eating places (I'll refrain from using the word restaurant) to choose from. Lots of (iced) seafood on display and you can have lots of different foods cooked right in front of you if that's your thing. A few choice smells lingered in the air but nobody seems to bother about them. There is a large market at the top of the road which sells almost every sort of cooked thing you can think of including scorpions and all manner of insects etc. Lots of souvenirs and cheap clothing on offer too. A big stage had been erected when we visited with a variety of Thai entertainment going on. Short trips back to hotels or nearby attractions are easy by taking a ride in a tuk-tuk (with loud disco sounds and lighting if you like). All in all a very entertaining town. If you fancy a busier time, a short trip into Patong will enlighten the senses. Some very nice big shopping malls there. While you're there, a walk along Bangla Road is a must.",4, February 2020
3147163,"Loved Karon beach, was lovely and clean and the water so warm and clear. Rented sun lounges for the day and hardly got hassled by anyone.",5, March 2020
3147164,"Stayed at the Phuket Orchid Spa and Resort.  Great resort, super friendly staff that go out of their way to help.",5, March 2020
3147165,"Nice beach busy lively loads going on, close to town no showers that i saw or toilets, sure they must go in the sea",5, February 2020
3147166,"I was very disappointed in how commercialised Karon Beach/Town was, not what I was expecting at all. Definately not like the photo above.",2, February 2020
3147167,While the beach is nice and good to walk on especially early morning do be careful if you want to go into the sea.   There is a rip tide which can sweep you out to sea.    There are several warning about this on the beach and also telling you what to do if you get caught in one so do read the instructions before going into the sea.,3, March 2020
3147169,"Nice beach to spend your time at. Many places to eat, water activities and volleyball nets. Water is transparent and ideal for swimming since it's so calm.There's also a nice small lake opposite the beach.",5, March 2020
3147175,"Very nice long and wide beach. Sand is powdery soft.  Water is very clear and clean. No rocks,gravel or shells. Lots of lounge chair and umbrellas to rent out  Sunsets are awesome!",5, February 2020
3147178,"One of the lesser crowded beach that is easily accessible. The beach is nice, quiet and good for family.",5, February 2020
3147179,Used to be a beach that was quieter than Patong but has grown a lot and is very busy nowadays and has lost a lot of its charm.,3, February 2020
3147180,"We were staying 6 nights, at the Pacific Club Resort, from 12th to 18th February. Our hotel was about 10 minutes walk from the beachOn our first day here, while out exploring and taking stock of the area, we did walk to the beach.It was such a disappointment, although the beach is situated in a picturesque bay area it was not very pleasant.There were row upon row of sunloungers and umbrellas, virtually touching each other, absolutely no personal space.There were areas of the beach where it was possible to spread beach mats and towels and enjoy the glorious sunshine. There is no shade here.Karon Park runs along the back of the beach, people were spreading out here under the shade of the trees.There was a variety of water sports available on the beach.",3, February 2020
3147188,Long stretch of sandy beach on which all the amenities are available. Snorkelling from rocks at either end can be hit or miss depending on tide height. Boat trips and water sports also available as well as sun loungers (for a price and get there early) and many refreshment vendors on and set back from beach. Sea generally calm although beach  does shelve quickly,5, February 2020
3147191,"After a week in Khao Lak where the beach is beautiful and cared for...no sunbeds, no smoking allowed, Karon Beach was a huge disappointment, very over crowded and the sea didn't seem as clear and clean as Khao Lak..just a personal view but not for me.",2, February 2020
3147196,"Very long clean beach with a good number of sun beds with umbrellas, sea calm and flat when I visited but I know it can be rough at other times of the year",5, February 2020
3147197,"Long stretch of golden sand , beautiful sunsets. Great beach for everyone young or old. Take your own mats or rent one of the many sunbeds",5, February 2020
3147198,Lovely beach with areas of sun beds but need to get up early to get out. Shame it does not have any food outlets. Lovely sunsets,5, February 2020
3147199,Karon Beach is very nice and safe.  There are plenty of activities to pay for (if you wish) and beds and parasols available.,5, January 2020
3147200,"Sand, crystal water, waves -everything like in heaven, only its very crowded. Well, its peak outthere",4, February 2020
3147203,This is a large public beach with plenty shops and restaurants nearby. There are many sunbeds or you can just sit on the sand.The sand makes a unique squishy sound when you walk. The water is clean and warm.,4, February 2020
3147208,"This is a very long beautiful beach, kept clean,plenty of sunbeds. Sand is soft,sea is clean warm and generally calm this time of the year. Loads of beach vendors,but none are pushy. Difficult to find fault of the beach itself.....lots and lots of Russians,but that applies to Karon  in general.Plenty of beach sports, jet ski etc,if that is your thing. Northern end of the beach is quieter,",4, February 2020
3147211,I do love a lovely beach but I'm afraid I wasn't keen on this one. It was very overcrowded and if you didn't get down before 10 beds were full the guys who own the beach beds can be very unfriendly I saw them chase 3 parties away gave them their money back and told them to do one. Knew they could pick and chose who they wanted on the beds.Also heat was unbareable after midday.,3, February 2020
3147212,"Clean beach and water, safe and good for water sport. Good for Families with kids, very nice sunset and the beach is excellent for walk",5, February 2020
3147217,"Spent Christmas Day on this beautiful beach, get there before 11 to make sure you get sun beds together if there are a few of you.",5, December 2019
3147219,"It felt like a snow under the feet, never ever experience anything like that, amazing stones in the end of the beach, so I would recommend to go for them straight from the beginning",5, February 2020
3147221,Karon beach is a good option for swimming but it is crowded and the chairs for some reasons are pushed back away from the beach.If I had to chose between karon and kata. I would kata beach.,4, January 2020
3147225,"This is one of three main beaches in the area.  Its the largest and probably the quieter of them.  The beach is kept clean and tidy although that is a challenge when there are so many people around.  The water is clear, warm and lovely to swim in.  However, there were life guards on view and warning signs indicating the potential for rip tides at certain times of the year.  If your sensible then its a really safe beach.The hotels in the area are generally low rise and spread out along the beach front.  So the visitors are generally spread out so it does nt seem as busy as some resorts you get these days.",4, January 2020
3147226,"I was expecting this beach to be less popular, sadly not, so many people here which was fine but didn't meet my expectations. Perfect for sunset but no restaurants directly in the beach. There are snack huts and massage huts on the beach though",3, February 2020
3147228,This is a beautiful beach and less busy the the Patong Beach. Just dont understand why no sunbeds are allowed here. Its white sand and quite wide and long,4, February 2020
3147237,Great and clean beach. If there would be more bars it would be even more nice. The area between the beach and the road could be cleaned from time to time.,4, January 2020
3147239,Beautiful with white Sandy Beach and clear water .not clear though like phi phi but yes excellent for sun bathing and swimming. Not very crowded but we'll equipped with people and tourists to not bore you. Night market near by beach is also colorful and full of massages centers.,5, December 2019
3147246,A large and long beach but sun beds far too overcrowded. Not much by way of beach bars/restaurants other than in Karon town. Better travelling to Kata beach or Kata Noi beach.,3, January 2020
3147254,Our favourite beach long clean sandy beach shops behind you for drinks and food all the way along ski hire etc also.We use it most days,5, January 2020
3147257,"Karon beach is one of the nicest we found on Phuket Island and although it got pretty busy towards the end of our stay, we were easily able to find available sunbeds a bit down the road. Just don't be lazy to walk for 5mins.",4, January 2020
3147258,"My boyfriend and I spent a lot of time on this beach while on holiday in Phuket. The beach is long and isn't overcrowded. It is walkable from one side to the other and makes a nice day walking along it. The sea is warm and we had fun jumping in the waves. Beach is nice and clean and there are fantastic little beach bars which sell the most amazing fruit shakes, beers and coconuts, perfect to cool down in the heat.",5, December 2019
3147261,Karon Beach is a lovely long sandy beach. It is flat so easy to walk on. It is over 4 KM in length The beach is busy but not super crowded. You can rent 2 lounge chairs with an umbrella for 200 Bhat the chairs are lined up at several locations along the beach A custodian will come by to give you your daily ticket stubThe major tourist group we encountered were Russian but many languages are heard. There are a couple of limited beverage stands along the beach but in many areas if you take a two minute stroll across the street that runs parallel to the beach there are lots of shopsSeadoos paddle boarding and para sailing are all available The beach is very clean,5, January 2020
3147265,"So and so, the beach itself is big but the sand and the water are not the bests ever. Surely the best part is the one on the beginning coming from Patong",3, February 2019
3147272,"Really nice beach to relax. Pristine very fine soft white sand and clear water with turquoise hue sets for the mood. Swim, walk bare foot, enjoy. All you will found around are foreigners here, locals you will see helping you get relaxed with massage offerings by the beach, other services. You have water activities available and snorkelling too on 1 corner",5, December 2019
3147274,"At the right of the beach, just keep walking or get a taxi, hire a bike you can get a typical Thai experience away from the rat race. There is a lovely Thai bar just up from the beach, lovely food etc. Sit there and watch the world go by or go to watch the magnificent sunset.",5, January 2020
3147281,"Perfect beach to spend your days at, soft sand, soft waves to relax in, wide and long beach never feels crowded. The area Karon is full of Russians everywhere everything is translated to Russian sometimes felt like Thai people speak better Russian than English. Food is good there are great places to find cheap food but everything else is overpriced. Gifts clothes etc. Loads of activities like jet ski water sports and parachute.",5, January 2020
3147283,"Beautiful, clean, not ever crowded, warm water.Close to great restaurants and 5 star resorts.I much prefer it over patong",5, January 2020
3147287,Sadly discovered this beach the day before we were leaving.  Highly recommend the beach is stunning and the palm trees in the background absolutely beautiful.  Caught the sunsetting here and the photos look unreal.,5, December 2019
3147290,"Very clean beach, you have to bring your own shade or rent one (if you are lucky to find available)Sandy beach with calm waters, however, current could be strong sometimes (it is open sea after all).Many water sport activities available (banana boat, jet ski, para-sailing, strom) however, a bit pricey. Well worth visiting. Personally I found it less crowded and cleaner than Patong beach (it could also have to do with the fact that i was staying at the Hilton Arcadia which is overlooking the beach).",5, December 2019
3147291,"We read bad reviews for Karon, but we were satisfied. Long and clean beach with hotels, bars and shops, you can rent a sunbed and do watersports (jet skiing, parasailing). You will enjoy it. Finally; you can go there for 40 bath with local (blue) bus.",5, January 2020
3147292,A stunning view with clear blue water and perfect places to swim and snorkel.It is also very clean and has a decent amount of shade.,4, January 2020
3147295,"It was a beautiful beach with clear water to swim and snorkel in, however it was very busy. It is quieter than Patong but busier than Kata.",4, January 2020
3147298,"Our experience on the beach, sitting in chairs or swimming on the water, was mostly good, rip currents aside.  I could have done with fewer people trying to sell us things.  And our experience with parasailing was dangerous and left us injured, so I wouldn't recommend that.",4, December 2019
3147299,"You won't be disappointed with this beach,it's picturesque. Beach umbrellas are available to rent for the day.",5, January 2020
3147303,Big beach. Great water and sand like all beaches on this coastal side of Phuket.We beach hopped on this day and ended up visiting 4 beaches. This was one of them.,4, December 2019
3147305,"Karon beach is very clean, soft sands and very clean water..  there are rentable umbrellas (shades) and sunbeds available. There are also several locals provides water sport activities, only downside they do really annoy other people during  take off or landing parasailing. They do it dangerously for the people who swimming  or sunbathing..",5, January 2020
3147309,"A truly beautiful beach, it's long coast line makes for lots of space so it does feel like you are sitting ontop of other beach goes, not much shade from trees so it's best to bring an umbrella, the waters are usually calm and warm making it a great place to lounge in the ocean.Beautiful and clean, a much nicer beach than patong",4, December 2019
3147311,"Karon beach is a great place for families. The beach is clean and offers some play areas and restaurants near by. Great for families. We stayed at Patong before, but I prefer Karon as it is much cleaner and quieter. There are many hotels and shops near by and it is always easy to find a tuk tuk or a taxi.",4, December 2019
3147317,Beautiful and clean beach where one can sit and enjoy the sunset or just walk around. You can also choose to enjoy the waves or swim in the sea. It is not too crowded which makes it one of the best beaches of Phuket.,5, November 2019

3147346,"Great beach, white soft sand turquoise clear waters, the waves added some fun.The beach has beach bars to buy drinks and snacks and obviously you have sellers on the beach selling items, however it's quite a lot less sellers than patong beachIt has a toilet and shower block to use for a small charge. Just of the beach is numerous bars shops and restaurants also local taxis and tuktuk service to take you back to your hotel. Visited the beach a few times during our stay as it was so nice. At the seas edge you can see big Buddha in the hills and kata view point over the other islands, its so relaxing and beautiful",5, December 2019

3147351,The Karon Beach is long with white sandy beach beautiful to walk on but its massive and if you need a good walk thats the place to go.We normally went there in the late afternoon to watch the sunset walking with your feet in the sea water and drink cold fresh coconut juice.,5, November 2019
3147353,"Karon Beach is massive - it takes a long time to walk along it, and on the road there are shops and food areas.  I found the beach had lots of areas where there was nobody there, but other ares had lots of people there.  The sand is good and clean but some people don't always clean up their rubbish.",4, November 2019
3147358,the beach is wide and quite long so nice to walk here during the day with your feet in the sea! Locals do sell you their food etc and some do shout but walk ahead is fine,4, December 2019
3147361,"This location is gorgeous, not as crowded at patong but some locals really lack respect , unlike lost thai people i came across. Either the language gap makes them that way or being purely commercial and wicked. Nyways most people ain't that ways but this guy at the karon beach renting beach chairs needed to be set straight.",3, December 2019
3147365,The beach is clean and long beach. you can find shops on the streets. and its really good for foreigners.,5, January 2019
3147366,"We personally preferred Karon beach over Kata and Patong. It was a bit calmer and less crowded more chilled. On a weekend there's a small market just at the entrance of the beach which makes getting eats and other pretty nice.It's just a personal preference. Whisky there is water sport activities and other going on here, it's still a way better beach to play in as well.",4, November 2019
3147367,more laid back than patongs hustle and bustle. a large stretch of fine sand and clear water. as usual plenty of hawkers selling a large range of goods but the further you walk away from the center the less hassle you get.,5, September 2019
3147370,"Staff very helpful and friendly, we enjoyed our visit The hotel was very central and near the beach We had B&B the breakfast was great, plenty on offerDefinitely would stay again",5, October 2019
3147371,Perfect family destination. Beach is huge and clean. Karon night market is good shopping and eating place. You can also find Indian restaurants around if you are bored with thai food. Tuk tuk here is bit costly and you need to bargain a lot.,5, November 2019
3147373,"Karon Beach was right by the hotel we were staying. The beach was warm and very clear. There is no service from the hotel as the beach is public, but there some locals you can rent an umbrella to get some shade.

3147403,This beach is why Thailand is so beautiful.  It has beautiful sand and blue water. Not crowded and quiet.,5, November 2019
3147404,This is my favourite beach in Patong. Karon is very relaxing place to go. If you wanted a peaceful beach in Patong must to to this one. Less people and less noise. We went here around 6 in the evening and we enjoyed it. But this place is far from town. Only few options for restaurants around. The good thing is that there are markets that you can go and drink alcohol and eat grilled seafoods. The prices are cheaper as compared to the center of patong. ️️,4, November 2019
3147405,I was here once again in August and found Karon Beach to be as enticing as ever. The waters were limpid and the sands powdery!,4, August 2019

3147415,"I did not like this beach at all! It was dirty and narrow, without sand and the waves came very up to the shoreline so basically there was not really a beach like a place to stay and hang out. not a lot of beds were provided in the area and again it was very dirty. we even saw rats going around. I regret spending a day there, instead of staying at Kata Beach where we were before",2, July 2019

3147425,"Karon beach was just across the road from our Hotel. There are multiple places to swim with lifeguards in duty all the way along.It was clean and not overcrowded and the water was clear and warm. There was also parasailing available towards the centre of the beach. Would recommend Karon beach over other beaches in the area. Avoid Patong beach with its muddy water, rubbish, overcrowding and massage tents.",2, September 2019

You can still feel as though you're on a private beach if you wander far enough. The water here was also much cleaner and crystal blue. Beautiful!",5, September 2019
3147449,"Patong is oversold with its nearby nightlife. Surin and Kamala are too secluded. Karon has just the right amount of people on its white clean sandy beaches. With Para Sailing and Swimming available on the beach along with beach shacks which serve drinks and offer guests opportunity just to soak in the surrounds or sun tan. The stretch is clean, long and a great place to hang around with your family. Right across the beach road, again the right amount of massage parlours, restaurants and also hotels. All in all, an excellent place for some family R&R",5, September 2019

3147466,"Water was perfect temp and waves were just right. Lots of people around. I felt safe being alone, as quality of people seemed like that whom would help me if I had trouble. Only had my cover up and room key in my bag (which no one knew), but it remained undisturbed with my shoes while I was in the water. Nice that it is on a strip with many food/drink/ shopping choices",5, September 2019
3147467,Was surprised there was surf here. Plenty of seats. Have to watch the kids with the water. Not the safest water.,5, September 2019
3147472,"Come on my Thai folk - you have a great beach (Karon Beach) but because of the plastic that washes up with each tide, the beach is somewhat unsightly... take care of your natural treasure, and clean the beach each morning/afternoon tide to keep the beach in pristine condition!",4, September 2019

3147478,"Karon Beach is located on the west coast of Phuket, south of Patong and north of Kata. Karon and these two beaches are known as the three major beaches of Phuket. Compared to Patong Beach, the coastline here is longer and wider, the water is clearer, the beach is softer, and there are fewer tourists. On this coastline of nearly 4 km, you can enjoy a view of the sea while walking. The location is lovely. The beach provides a beautiful view of the sea, but it has large waves, so be careful when swimming.",5, August 2019

3147483,Karon Beach was just one of a few beaches we visited around the Patong and Karon areas. The beach was much more enjoyable than Patong or Kalim and easy to access. Few peddlers during the low season. The water and sand were very clean.,4, September 2019
3147484,The beach is long with beautiful sand and there are various water activities available. The beach is westward facing so you can see some great sunsets here too. My main disappointment was seeing the huge amount of plastic debris washed up on the beach. I wish the local community authorities would put some effort into cleaning up their beaches otherwise tourists will go elsewhere and they will see a step decline in business!,4, August 2019

3147515,"A nice place with an alright beach (although waves are extremely strong). There are a few bars but not a lot so you will find yourself going to some several times. Not much nightlife, however the nearby Patong (which you can get a tuk tuk to for 400 baht) is the place to be after sundown (not for kids). On the subject of kids, this is more of an adult only destination with there not being much for kids other than what your hotel has to offer (if they offer anything at all) with the beach maybe being a bit rough for them.",3, August 2019
3147518,"Lovely beach, we stayed at Horizon Karon Beach Resort so just across the road. Lovely family friendly beach. Clean too.",4, August 2019
3147520,"Very good beach , clear water , they are people walking selling stuff but we get that everywhere anyways. Just across the road there is a lot of shops.

Overall it's a nice beach with an amazing sun lol xxxx",5, August 2019
3147521,Finally decided to visit Phuket because of the beaches but at first glance we were pretty disappointed. Beaches themselves are nice - wide and with nice sand but unfortunately very dirty. They look much better in the afternoon (tide).,4, August 2019
3147522,So much to see. Locally and tours are well organised from local vendors who are not there to rip you off. Bars are well run and do not accept rowdy customers. Bar girls are there to make you welcome with a smile. The massage girls are genuine.,1, April 2019
3147524,Beautiful white sand at one end. The other was full of litter and plastic. However the sea is much too rough to swim in which was a shame.,2, August 2019

3147529,One of the most popular beaches at Phuket island - always packed with lots of tourist. Some places to eat and drink around - but the quality is not that high .,3, July 2019
3147530,"Beautiful place for sunset. U can reach here by taxi but it's expensive. Better to come here by motorbike. Easy to move around. If you prefer walking, it's also nice but the weather is hot in here.",5, July 2019
3147533,"This beach is beautiful, been sands and big waves in the sea. The beach is catered by shops and restaurants just over the road so it's perfect for a day out. The usual sunbeds with umbrellas catering for the tourists at a cost. Roughly 100thb There are also volleyball nets too. Negatives:- There's a build up of plastic and other litter on the beach that's been swept inland which is a shame. - Lack of toilets - the usual beach sellers constantly walking by offering to sell everything from food to sunglasses. Gets a bit annoying after an hour or two. Would be better if they had stalls on the beach and let people come to them.",4, July 2019
3147534,"Fantastic looking beach, one of the best in Asia. However it has big rips so wouldn't recommend swimming in it. Still a great beach.",4, July 2019

3147539,"The beach itself is not crowded. Beach chair and umbrella rentals are available along the entire beach. It is enjoyable to spend time and watch the sun set. The town itself is more layback than Patong Beach with enough restaurants and shops to dine and shop. It has the vacation feel, far more calmer than the highly commercialized, chaotic Patong Beach.",4, July 2019
3147541,"I visited Patong some years back with my daughter. I tried Karon this time around, hearing that it is less crowded and commercial.Karon is beautiful, compared to Patong. While it cannot rival Patong on the entertainment scene, Karon is charming with its less polluted beach, parasailing and quieter neighbourhood. I particularly like the sunset. It is more serene with less people selling stuff.NB: i visited during off peak season in the Summer.",4, July 2019
3147544,Karon beach is less crowded and very neat. You will enjoy the sunset. Very close to good hotels and restaurants.,5, July 2019
3147546,We stayed at the centara grand so were very spoilt. This  was a great family friendly resort. Kids love the water slide and jump rock. Even a little wave for the kids to surf. Perfect outlook.,4, July 2019
3147548,"I was here 2 years ago and hoped that my memory of the litter had exaggerated in my mind, but unfortunately not. Such a beautiful beach, but plastic bottles and containers and old thongs all along the shoreline, make it look anything but nice. I can't believe the local council doesn't make more of an effort to clean it up.",2, July 2019

3147562,"Unlike Pattaya and Patong, Karon is clean and peaceful!! Good for travellers who want to spend quality time in hygienic atmosphere.",5, June 2019
3147563,"Really looking run down and sleazy.  The town was never flash, but in the two years since we were here it has taken a plunge/scunge.  Even the monument looks as if it needs a water blast and a coat of paint.  Less rubbish than Sanur in Bali, but still, too much.  We love our hotel, The Mandarava, pity we can't move it out of Karon.  Seedy.  Better than Patong, worse than Kata.  Maybe time to return to Kamala.",2, June 2019
3147571,The day we went it was cold and had started to rain but the beach was beautiful! We had to cross the street from the hotel which was super busy but it was a short 10 minute walk from where we were. The beach was clean and had a few guys doing beach and water activities at a reasonable cost,5, May 2019
3147573,We went in off season but the weather and scenery was just magnificent! The beach near the road is a nice level surface and we had no problem walking from Jaya to Karon along the boardwalk. Lots of parasailing and jetski activities as well as Nice hotels.,5, June 2019

3147582,This is the first time I have actually stayed in Karon. I am usually a Patong holiday maker. I love it here. It’s not so in your face and the beach is a lot cleaner including the sea. Thoroughly recommend it here for couples or families,5, June 2019
3147583,We loved this beach and my husband particularly loved to swim in the sea here. It was too powerful for me and I wouldn't recommend it for kids at windy times. Obey the flags and its a great day out. Plentyvof places to eat or drink close by.,5, July 2018
3147586,I did my morning runs for one end to the other with amazing view and a good 2.5km one way. They even had an open air gym on the side which was a great place for work out by the beach.,5, May 2019

3147590,Karon Beach is one of the best beaches in Phuket. I prefer the southern end of the beach. Take care during the monsoon season as most west coast beaches in Phuket can be dangerous to swim from late May to October.,5, May 2019
3147591,it's very nice & long beach with clean water where we enjoyed swimming but sun-chair with umbrella was expensive!,4, May 2019

3147600,"Karon Beach is great Beach and pretty clean so pack up your own trash. The Beach is long, clean nice sand and great sunsets.If you want quiet you can have it here, if you want a beach chair or parasail you can have it.

3147611,"Only went to the beach for sunsets and Thai sunsets never disappoint!... beach can get pretty crowded, so you have to find a good spot to take photos.. the sea is pretty rough here and can be quite dangerous to swim in and gets deep pretty quickly in places - so be aware of this if you visit here - is also prone to riptides so take note of where you are swimming in this part of the sea",4, April 2019

3147614,"The main part of the beach is well maintained. Many sunbeds available for hire and parasending and jetski activities on sale. Sand is generally clean.Toilet facilities are limited and require payment. There are no cafés on the beach, but lots just across the road about 100m back from the sea.Water was warm. However, there were jelly fish stingers around during our visit which resulted in some uncomfortable sores and irritation that lasted around 8 hours.The major disappointment is getting to the waterfront. You will have to walk from the road via paths through a wooded area. In this area there are children's playgrounds too. But there is a lot of rubbish in this area. We saw lots of plastic and glass debris. This included the playground areas. You will need shoes on in this area or risk cutting your feet.It is such a shame that people can't take their litter away to dispose of properly and that so much plastic waste will end up being washed into the sea from this area.",3, April 2019
3147615,"Karon Beach is without a doubt very beautiful. The beach itself is very long, and so the crowd are spread across the beach and it was not very crowded at any one place. The sand isnt the smoothest amongst the beaches I went to, but the water is very clear. The beach was quite clean in general, except for some bits and pieces of styrofoam mixed in with the sand.The waves in Karon beach were quite rough, and take note of the flags hoisted by the lifeguards to know where to swim. You can also book a beach lounge chair for the whole day for 200 baht, or you could bring your own picnic mat/towel to sit on the sand. There were also less people trying to sell you parasailing/jet ski packages here as compared to Patong beach. Airbnb apartments can be quite far from the beach, and there are a wide range of hotels just across the road from Karon beach.",4, May 2019
3147616,lots of room. big clean beach. you can find space not over crowded. can have strong current so if not good swimmer be careful. lots of food restaurants on opposite side of road. mid way down beach by road circle most busy food. down left hand side nice rocky outcrops.  full of Russians. even signs and menus in Russian.  a bit off putting they have taken over.,4, May 2019
3147618,Good clean beach safe for kids and plenty of stalls and food on the main road can get busy but worth a stop,5, May 2019
3147619,One of the most beautiful beaches what we like in Phuket. Crystal clear water and spectacular sunset. We spent most of the days on Karon beach.,5, April 2019
3147620,"Karon Beach is close to Patong Beach (where most visitors typically choose to stay when in Phuket) and great option, for a short visit or longer stay. The ocean here is inviting and plenty of room on the sand (see my YouTube) if you want to go for a swim or just a walk-about/",4, May 2019
3147621,"Nothing but stingers in the water and rude russians on the beach. the restaurants surrounding the beach also looked pretty bleak. Much prefer Kata beach. Thank you, next!",1, April 2019
3147622,"Karon Beach es muy tranquila para estar en la playa relajado, mucha arena no hay aglomeraciones, me gusto mas que Patong.",5, April 2019
3147623,"Waves, like all beaches can get a bit rough,  but there's some days where it's perfect, beach is NOT patrolled by lifesavers and can get some decent rips along it.  We only visit once a year for a couple of weeks and do our bit as a visitor by picking up any washed up rubbish from the ocean and also the rubbish from visitors who are animals and leave their rubbish there not being bothered to walk it 50 meters to the nearest bin. On a hot day expect to get burnt by the sun and the hot sand.",5, May 2019
3147626,"Beach was great, lots if waves to go in the sea with the gopro, make sure to wear sunscreen or you'll be sunburnt bad, happened to me. 200 tbh to hire a parasol with two sunbeds for the day, can leave and come back anytime. Just be sure to return to a sunbed in the designated area where you were appointed, think theres a bit of a turf war between the guys working for each sunbed zone. Great beach!",5, April 2019
3147631,"Great place for relaxing and tanning.Family friendly, BUT be careful for dangerous rip tides.More quiet in Kata, more noise and partying in Patong.",4, April 2019
3147632,We spent  the day at Karon beach.  The beach is clean and great for couples who want a quieter day at the beach. There are plenty of sunbeds to hire for 100baht for the day. The sea was really clear and clean compared to patong beach.  The vendors on the beach strangely enough I found great.  They walked pasted with thier sign and you just say yes or no. Lots of tuk tuks to return back to patong for 300baht.  They also have activities on the beach but they are slightly up from the sunbeds so you don't really notice them. Nice and close to karon town if you want to walk into town to get some lunch.,5, April 2019
3147634,"Karon Beach is a nice open beach, with a selection of restaurants and cafes alongside it, unfortunately the sewage system in front of it needs updating and the drains are very smelly!",3, April 2019
3147640,"Karon is about 6 km from Patong a more popular destination for part goers. What Karon beach offers is a delight if you want to enjoy serene and quite beach destination. Motor boats and activities do hurt the beach lovers. Costs you 300-400 baht for transportation, I waited for bus which costs 170 baht though but they run at a gap of 1 hour. Visit the shops lined across the beautiful town.",5, April 2019
3147641,"Clean sand,  nice waveLounge and sunshade available for rent. Massage hutt,  water sport activities, food and drinks available. Actually the kids and I voted this beach the best over Patong,  freedom and Kata beaches. Next time that where we going. C U Around",4, April 2019
3147642,"No public services, no bathrooms, no drinking water, no cleaningmaintenance. Will load only nice pictures here just hope at some point locals will start taking care of their lovely place.",3, April 2019
3147643,"At the beginning of our trip, the water at Karon was quite calm. However, after about day 2 of our stay, the water was quite rough and the waves were knocking the children over. We were also bitten daily by sea lice! The water looks clean but there was rubbish in the ocean further down the beach.",3, April 2019
3147646,"The weather is always fine, the water in a good temperature and normally clean up to 10:30 am, the time when they start running the water scooters and the boats pulling the parachutes. All of them liking oil to the water and annoying everyone with the noise.It could be a great beach if they simply forbid these scooters and boats and leave the beach to the people.There are some sewers that could be easily eliminated.",3, April 2019
3147648,Beach clean and calm in April. Water very warm. Nice to walk along in the morning. Not overly busy either.,4, April 2019
3147651,Experienced the best weather and only 1 day was the sea too rough to swim in. Clear flag signage notified all to the dangers on that day. The beach was not crowded. The sand and water beautiful. The place was very clean and safe during the day and night. Easy walking distance from my hotel.  Casual stroll takes you from Karon to Kata with plenty of places to stop for a drink on or off the beach. Highly recommend.,5, April 2019
3147656,"Karon Beach was cool...just not post card worthy. It’s a HUGE step up from patong beach (which to me is packed and filthy), but I would recommend kata or Kata noi beaches early in the morning instead of Karon. If you want that clearer water and not thousands of tourists. They aren’t far from Karon (about 15-30 mins).",3, April 2019
3147662,i love this beach as i mentioned before it have white sand and water is very clean even beach is also very clean.,5, April 2019
3147663,"Beautiful, clean beach, Sun beds cheap. Sea was the warmest I’ve ever been in, great fun playing in the waves.We visited a number of beaches around Phuket this one was the closest to our hotel and it was my favourite.",5, April 2019
3147665,"We stayed here for 10 days. As I always do when on holidays, I walk the beach end to end. AMAZING ! It's wide and long...  White super soft sand on my bare feet!!As for the sea it's cyrstal clear.",5, March 2019
3147666,"Karon Beach is beautiful. In the early morning you get to meet all the locals doing their walls and jogging with their dogs. The water was always warm. I took a bag and collected washed up fishing net to put in the bin. Oh, I can’t leave out, the sunsets, well they are pretty spectacular too!",4, April 2019
3147674,"Nice beach. Can be rather crowedMany Russian touristBetter beaches in Vietnam, Thailand and other parts of S E AsiaPhuket is rather expensive compared to rest of Thailand",3, March 2019
3147675,"I recently got back from Phuket where I stayed in the Karon area, so Karon Beach was my local beach. It's a nice long beach with some good views, the surf is good and you can always find a spot to sunbathe. There's many local shops nearby if you fancy a smoothie or a beer, sun bed rates a bit cheaper than Kata, I paid 100bht for sun bed per day.",4, April 2019
3147677,Now has massages and beach chairs beach in better condition than 4 years ago water can be a tad rough with currents Kata beach better for swimming,4, March 2019
3147678,"Fantastic beach. Spend hours in the Ocean swimming. Absolute therapy..!! Calm and peaceful place, close (walk) to restaurants and convenience stores(stocked with all needs). Walking distance to Kata Beach(which is in a Bay),also extremely  enjoyable, with open air Food Restaurant Markets, situated adjacent to the beach. Eat and enjoy fresh food and beverages with a friendly vibe .",5, November 2018
3147679,For us this beach was not really suitable. The waves were too large for a 2 & 5 year old. With small children it would have been better on a beach with gentler waves. Only able to spend 30 minutes there as the boys were upset.,2, April 2019
3147680,"We spent our first Thailand holiday at a resort in Karon Beach. I can say it is a great place for families or those who are looking for a less hectic environment to enjoy your holiday. Still very close to Patong (10 min in a Tuk tuk) and very close to all the major sights I.e. Kata Beach, Buddha, Temples, Old Phuket town etc etc.Plenty of markets and restaurants and local food options all around Karon.",4, April 2019
3147681,"Lovely sandy beach with no stones, no litter, no seaweed. Shelves steeply so not so safe for non-swimmers or small children. The beach road is rather touristy. Recommend Anda Cafe for a relaxing beer.",5, April 2019
3147683,"Karon Beach is a quieter location than Patong. Lots of restaurants and bars. Beautiful beach with options to hire JetSki’s or parasail. Getting around has become ridiculously expensive. Bring good walking shoes and avoid the Tuk Tuk and taxi styled mafia. Perhaps choose the resort or hotel accommodation’s location carefully to avoid the taxi scams.Thai people (except for Tuk Tuk drivers) are warm, friendly people who are always ready with a smile. We did see quite a few rats scurrying about the streets but mainly late at night.",5, April 2019
3147685,"Long stretch of sandy beach. Crowded in parts but can get away from the crowds and the motor sports. Busier later in the day. Amazing place for sunset. Clean beach and clear, warm water.",5, March 2019
3147686,"Beautiful beach, not many hotels have direct access. Plenty of food places, but watch out for prawns which have sat in the sun all day..also look out for the stream which is clearly not a stream...Great little bar at the north end, just past the karon beach hotel and at the foot of the steps to the ""on the hill"" apartments (very good). Unfortunately the town is smelly and the open drains mean you need to pick your bars carefully so u dont get a wiff while ur eating. The weekend night market (in the grounds of the temple) is worth a visit for sure.",5, March 2019
3147688,"The beach is really pretty and the water is lovely and clear but the sea lice are rampant and they sting. More on that later!You can of course hire a deck chair or you can plop yourself down anywhere you like.There is the usual assortment of vultures trying to get you to para fly or hire jet skies and then there are the hawkers that never go away. All adds to the ambiance. The beach is much cleaner these days which is great but there is still quite a bit of litter even though there are plenty of bins. The locals that hire out the deck chairs seem to have no desire in keeping their “patches” clean which is disappointing. On the plus side there were plenty of tourists walking and picking up rubbish and then there were those that contributed.Now, onto the Sea LiceSome days they are there and some days they are not. The internet tells me they are microscopical and live on jelly fish.I got horribly bitten on our first and second day and didn’t go back into the sea at Karon. My torso was completely covered in bites and we had to get antiseptic body wash and an antibiotic cream. It was nasty .",3, March 2019
3147689,"Long, clean beautiful beach.  Stayed for one week and enjoyed the view and walks at sunset.  Only one rainy day, and that just made for an even more interesting red sunset.",4, September 2018
3147693,"Positives:Beautiful crystal blue seaSome fish if snorkling, but you've got to look hard.Free from litterA long beach, so less busy at either endsNegatives:Very crowdedMostly Russians.Fairly noisy beach, so we were unable to chill.Topless bathing woman (completely inappropriate and disrespectful to locals)Overall, will not be going back.",3, March 2019
3147694,Really great view... great when you going by bike because of great view and cosy... feel the village environment before to reach the location..,4, March 2019
3147695,Went here on monday and it was a nice place walked along the beach and it was good for places to drink and eat,5, March 2019
3147696,A picturesque view truly to mesmerised.Water activities can be rented out for those adventurous people and a subtle beach to appreciate the sea and shoreline at its finest.,5, March 2019
3147697,This beachnis quiter than the other beaches in Phuket. It is very scenic and beautiful for pictures. Also a very romantic place for couples.,5, March 2019
3147698,On the small road from Karon beach leading up to the Old Phuket resort there is a typical tourist shop selling mainly beach items located next to the shop named ”ISLAND CREATION ”. I bought a pair of sandals there and after only a few hours of use I noticed that a part of the sole of one of them had broken off. I went back to the shop but they refused to give any kind of compensation for the broken sandal. Instead they offered me to buy new sandals with 100 Baht discount on their starting price. Thus this is certainly not a shop to recommend or go back to!,1, March 2019
3147703,We visited Karon beach in Nov'18. Beach was really beautiful and kept really clean. We saw foreigners taking a dip in lovely Andaman sea. It was a hot sunny day and we along with kids enjoyed a lot in this beautiful beach.,5, November 2018
3147707,"Karon beach is very nice, the sea is clear, the sand is wonderful. Only there are not trees, so there is no shade... But restaurants are very good, the food is delicious!",4, February 2019
3147708,Karon is one of the longest beach in Phuket and the 3rd in beach popularity. It enjoys a vast stretch of white sand with a decent choice of dining and nightlife but never seems to draw crowds of tourists (which might be a good thing). The beach is also known to make a fun squishy sound when walking on the sand.,5, February 2019
3147710,A beautiful beach away from all the hassle. The  best part about the beach is that it is not over crowded and has a mix of international crowd. Few restaurants and minimum disturbance by the sale people.Must visit if you are with family or couple or someone who purely wants to enjoy the sun and the sea .,5, March 2019
3147711,We didn’t use this beach as we was driving past we kept seeing big signs with rip tide so gave it a miss we did go down in the evening to the restaurants and shops was lovely,4, March 2019
3147716,Beautiful long beach Clean and smooth calm sea.love this beach that's why I returned this yearNot to busy just about right.,5, March 2019
3147719,"Beautiful beach, but crowded, the chairs to lay down are also and broken... They don't care..Restaurants near by are touristic and bad quality...",3, March 2019
3147729,Nice beach yes .expected more though.plenty shops and bars you won't be bored. Just wasn't the paradise I expected I guess. Pity about the rats everywhere in the area ,3, February 2019
3147730,My favourite beach by far. Easy to get to on the blue song Taew local bus from Phuket town. Takes a bit to get there but so worth it. Buses are ever 20 to 30 minutes but last one back is 4ish.The water is Crystal clear and the sand is super soft and clean. Shade available also and umbrellas and loungers. Water sports available also.,5, February 2019
3147734,We spent a bit of time here on our last trip and you could just sit in the water all day long! It does get a bit busy so if you want a lounge & umbrella you need to get there early - we just put towels under a tree in the shade as it was really hot. The facilities are limited but there are toilets & showers for a small charge & the main shopping/eating area is just across the road so no problems for a meal or drink.  Also on the weekends there is a market just off the beach towards one end where you can get some great local food & cold drinks. Would highly recommend this beach for a swim.,5, February 2019
3147735,"Karon beach is nice and spacious with white sand all the way. At certain areas it is possible to rent sun beds and umbrellas, but they have put as many as possible in the area, so you will have to be friends with your “neighbor”. I would recommend a hotel with a pool to combine with the beach experience.",4, March 2019
3147744,Great but could be cleaner. Area around shops and bars is dirty and needs cleaning. But away from there it is lovely,5, March 2019
3147745,Food was excellent . The best Indian food one can have in phuket .Staff was helpful and the atmosphere is awesome,5, March 2019
3147746,"Lovely beach with enough space for everybody. We stayed  a week in Karon at Avista Grande hotel and went almost daily to the beach.if you are early enough (9-9.30am) you can rent sunbeds+umbrella for 200 Bahts a day, if not, plenty of space to install your towel directly on the sand.You have enough restaurant nearby for lunch/dinner options, and also enough shops around.Snorkelling options as well, we went often on the south part (whereRuam Thep and On the rock restaurants are).We will definitely go back there.",5, February 2019
3147748,Amazing place the buildings are lovely and the people are so nice. It's that good we are going back this year.,4, June 2018
3147753,"We went here hoping for something else .We are in our late 50s and hoping for a beautiful laid back snorkelling holiday .Don’t waste your luggage allowance on snorkelling gear .Very noisy manic atmosphere in the shops lining the road .Beach was nice enough but heaving with people and beach sellers ,even massage on the beach if that’s your thing.Plenty of places to eat across from the beach",3, March 2019
3147754,"One Of the best beach i been to here in Phuket, nice view, clean and you have your calm time. Nice sand and good resturants",5, March 2019
3147756,Quiet Clean Beach away from hustle and bustle of Patong Beach. Safe for children to swim as it has clean gentle waves with fine white sand. You need to hire deck chairs & umbrellas on most beaches. Plenty of food places around.,5, February 2019
3147757,Came to karon for a day out with my wife. much quieter and less hustle as compared to Patong. Crystal clear and calm water which is friendly for all users. Deck chairs avail for rent as well. A really good place to chill and spent a whole day.,5, February 2019
3147758,A long clean beach. So many people. But such a lovely beach. Clean water and gentle waves. Nice to enter the water and swim. Lovely white sand.,5, February 2019
3147760,"Do not hire from Tod’s motorbike hiring.The 17th february 2019 at 12:15 I rented a motorbike. I took plenty of photos 4 minutes later at 12:19. While I was taking photos I noticed that passanger right foot peg was missing and the aluminum where the foot peg should have been attached was broken, and there was ”aluminium rust” in the cracks and there was a lot of bubbles under the paint, obviously an old damage. I informed Tod about the damage but he said it was an old damage and nothing to worry about. The following next day when I returned the motorbike, Tod inspected the motorbike and told me that I have damaged the motorbike and that I have to pay for the foot peg and the broken aluminium plate where the foot peg should have been attached. I said that it was an old damaged and that I also informed them yesterday at the time of renting that there was a damaged/missing foot peg. He said that I did not informed them and that I still had to pay for the damaged. I then showed Tod the photos that I took 1 minute after the hiring contract was written the day before, he then told me that I took the photos after the damage was done, I then showed him the date and time that was logged on the photos, he said that I had manipulated the photo and that everyone can manipulate date and time on photos taken with mobile camera.I had some luck, because while we were standing there arguing a young couple came to rent a motorike- so loud and clear and so that nearby people could hear what I was saying I told the couple not to rent at Tod’s place because he will try to make you pay for damages you not caused.Tod then turned to me and said ok here is your passport.Some of you will now say-never leave your passport as deposit, leave a copy of your passport instead. But then you will not be able to rent a motorbike, because they do not accept a copy, only passport. Now some of you will say- leave money as deposit together with a copy of the passport, but they do not accept this either. I can’t figure out how to attach photo to this page, but if I could I would have attached photo of the contract which has specified date and time, together with the photos taken 1 minute after the contract was handed over to me, the photos also have specified date and time (the time on the photo shows swedish time 06:16 and Thailand is 6 hours ahead of sweden so 06:16+6 hours is 12:16.",1, February 2019
3147764,"I don’t know how this place makes it into the list for the top beaches in Thailand. The place is mostly crowded, full of sun beds and parasols in parts. All along the beach road is bin bags of rubbish with rats about after sunset. The road up from the beach with bars and restaurants has no pavement and big open grated drains. The smell is terrible. You can see where the smell comes from when you walk from Karon to kata (disgusting)",1, February 2019
3147766,"It is a long beach, picturesque, great for walks at low tide, good for swimming (watch jelly fish at certain times of the year), and good for snorkelling at each end.",5, February 2019
3147769,Lovely beach with warm waters. Can be a little crowded at times.. jet skies and para gliding a little scarry. Sun beds available 100 baht. Also beach massage available. Worth a visit,4, February 2019
3147770,"Karon has a nice beach, nice sea food restaurants and places for shopping. It's not overcrowded like Patong.A place where you can enjoy your stay as couple or family in relaxed atmosphere.",4, December 2018
3147772,We loved our stay in Karon beach. It’s a busy town but very relaxed and friendly. Not much hassle only a few people trying to sell stuff and if you say no they just move on. Beach is beautiful and there are some good restaurants and bars. We will definitely come back,5, February 2019
3147776,Went with family of four adults. Karon is nice and not as busy as what Phuket Town and Patong seemed. Beaches okay but too many rude people( mostly foreigners living there) even the nice Thai people commented on them. Lots to see and do enjoyed walk from Buddha through jungle and walked back from Karon view point.Nice get away some great food  esp at markets but not as cultural as other Asian places been to.,4, February 2019
3147777,"Its a stunning beach although too many oeaple compare to other beaches in asia , still much better than patong beach nearby",4, February 2019
3147778,"Just came back from my 9th visit to Thailand, and will be my last. the Thai people have became so money hungry and losing the hospitality that they was so good at. The taxi drivers talk to tourist like dirt and demand extortion sums for short journeys, the bar prices are now dearer than London. The sun beds on Karon beach was so dirty and tacky also. Please get back to what you was good at and stop ripping people off or you will lose a valuable income.",1, February 2019
3147780,Karon Beach - simply stunning. Will return very soon. Stayed at Centara grand beach resort - very peaceful and away from the noise.,5, February 2019
3147783,I got here from Patong by taxi 1000bath (2ways)  it was amazing view and Karon and Kata Beach is not far from here so you can visit all this spots,5, February 2019
3147786,Near the Patong beach near Phuket. Very long beautiful beach. Not crowded and mainly tourists who come for a stroll or a swim. very close to resorts and very peaceful. Not a place to look for the night life like the Patong beach.,4, January 2019
3147793,"I know that lot of people have mentioned that this beach is crowded, but trust me if you are coming from Patong beach, this place is much less crowded and quieter. The beach is very long and water not to deep, so its easy to swim and have fun.",4, January 2019
3147794,"Best time to see this beach is late afternoon. Crowds of tourists vying for limited umbrellas and lounge chairs. If you just want to walk this beach , it’s a beautiful walk. Parasailing, jet ski are available. Heed the warnings about the rip tides during the season.",4, February 2019
3147795,I was told that the water would be much cleaner at this beach close to Patong. And that's true because there are fewer boats. This is not a small town and the beach is lovely. There are many resorts and restaurants,5, February 2019
3147796,"Best beach, perfect water temperature and waves just to move you a little up and down. This is our second time in Karon and we are glad we are here. This is a family oriented place with lots of place to eat and sede beaches. T is a must in Thailand just to relax and enjoy life.",5, February 2019
3147800,"A quieter, tamer and more civilized beach than patong. We went for a swim a couple times. Hours fly by in the warm waves. If you want more action, patong is not far.",4, February 2019
3147802,"Karon beach is beautiful - soft powdery sand, gentle sloping beach with shallow waters,clear and beautiful blue waters.The most amazing sunset view!Only 1 drawback - things that sting/bite in the water, many of them. Sea lice/bits of jellyfish? Not sure, does not seem harmful but leaves little red marks that itch for a few days.An option to renting a deck chair is to buy your own mat from the mini markets around (cheaper than a day's rental of a deck chair).Grab/tuktuk/taxi fares are relatively high for this part of the world, especially for short rides (e.g. 200Baht for <2km for tuktuk, or 420Baht for Grab). Renting a motorbike could be an economical option depending on your plans.",3, February 2019
3147809,"plenty of space.! long, clean white sand. clear waters. we had a great time in the beautiful beach and sea of Karon.  was just sorry didn't stay in hotel in Karon instead of patong.",5, January 2019
3147810,"First of all Karon Beach is massive. We found out little slice of heaven directly opposite Novotel Karon. Not as crowded, but lovely clear water, soft sand, and a view of the Big Buddha to top it off. Walk up 3 minutes or less further and you have a row of great cheap authentic eats. Offers the same amenities as Patong Beach, but less crowded and more chill.",5, January 2019
3147812,"If you are lookin for a super clean,non crowded,whitesand beach, its Karon.Way better than Patong beach.Cafe/shops are verynearby.You can take the airport bus from Patong(100b per person). Beach is free.Dont worry bout lockers.Supersafe to leave ur stuff under ur towel.Highly recommended.Oct is the perfect month.",5, October 2018
3147828,The karon beach is long clear and nice but it’s quite full to much people maybe because of the season. The sand is soft the water nice and cold.,3, January 2019
3147829,Phuket is over developed in general. The beaches are beautiful but suffer from overcrowding with attendant problems such as litter. Karon appears to be one of the better beaches but relaxing and romantic it isn’t,3, January 2019
3147831,We had 4 nights at Karon beach. Went to the beach twice. Water was warm but really bad with sea lice. Felt like little electric shocks. Too many people trying to sell product to you. Plenty of sun loungers/umbrellas to hire on beach paid 300 baht for 2 loungers and an umbrella.  Nice long beach to walk along.,4, January 2019
3147835,"Beaucoup plus calme qu' à Patong , elle mesure au moins 5 km ! Moins de jeunes turbulents et bruyants ! Sports nautiques et parachute quand même !",5, January 2019
3147836,If you want a real representation of Thailand DO NOT go to Phuket - the wholeIsland is over priced for tourists and the beach resorts resemble Benidorm at best. For a more authentic experience head north or to other islands where the locals appreciate you being there - having been to Thailand many times I will NEVER come to Phuket again.,1, January 2019

3147849,"In living in Phuket for many years, Karon has become one of my favorite beaches, along with the array of shops. Even during the monsoon season when the wind and rain are prevalent, Karon stands out as an enjoyable place to visit and meet up with friends due to its diversity and character.",5, December 2018
3147854,Loved this beach! I would highly recommend it!Beautiful waters and a great beach!A perfect place to relax for sure.Water activities was available.Shops were nearby.It is better than Kata beach! I would highly recommend visiting both tough if you have the time to spare!,4, January 2019
3147855,"The beach was great but crowded, Go early if you want to get a chair and umbrella. The water was clear and warm",5, December 2018
3147856,"Nice fine grain sand, beautiful surroundings and the beach is vast. Also happy to see some sun chairs and restaurants here and there beginning to come back. Only drawdown is the river between the main road and the beach, it's heavily polluted and stinks, so you don't want to be near it, though it only follow the beach for a short bit so it's easy to avoid.",4, January 2019
3147858,A beutiful peaceful beach where you can relax.  After a night of partying this beach is the place to be.,5, December 2018
3147859,This was a nice beach.   Just stay away from the area where the sewage bleeds into the water.   It was not very crowded even during the holiday.,4, December 2018
3147860,"The places of Karon beach that we visited we didn't like at all. It was crowded, noisy and the sunbeds were dirty. So, we didn't even stay, but chose to go back to the pool of our hotel, which was also busy, but at least seemed to be cleaner.",2, January 2019
3147862,"Nice beach with crystal clear water and nice sand , it was amazing to walk on the nice beach and spend some quality time.",4, December 2018
3147864,Another lovely beach which looked nice & clean. Stalls all nearby selling food & the usual touristy items. Great spot to people watch & way quieter than Patong beach!!,4, January 2019
3147866,"Spent Xmas and New Years in Karon and it was just beautiful. It’s not as big  as Kata and had the perfect blend of calmness, while still some great restaurants and bars off the main beach road. If travelling during Xmas watch out for venues that put on buffets as they are over priced, food isn’t great and over all not great value for money. Beach was lovely. We stayed in Moveninpick hotel which again was lovely.",5, January 2019
3147867,Lovely beach and not as busy as Patong Beach. Get there early if you want a sun-bed which can be rented for 200 TB for the day.  We got there around 10am and all the sun beds were taken but we only waited around 15mins before 2 became available. There’s restaurants opposite the beach where we grabbed lunch after which topped the afternoon off perfectly. Highly recommend if you want to go to a beach that’s not overly crowded. TIP - Try the freshly blended mixed fruit smoothie for 120 TB.,5, January 2019
3147868,Karon beach is probably the best beach in Phuket because here you can choose if you lay down on a sunbed with small food and drinks nearby or find a quiet spot where almost no one will disturb you.,5, December 2018
3147869,"Lovely beach, clean with clear sea but no where near enough sun beds to rent. They were all taken by 9.30 and there is no other shade.",4, December 2018
3147870,"I prefer this beach to Patong! It’s a good place to relax with kids, but it’s a bit too crowded. Nice waves to frolic in!",3, January 2019
3147872,Beautiful beach and scenery. Lovely first thing in the morning but gets very busy and touristy later on,4, January 2019
3147873,We walked 20 minutes to the beach and got there at 10.15 in the blistering heat to only find every bed and umbrella had been taken. So we decided to walk further down the beach and found the same problem. We weren't sure if this was due to going on a Sunday but in all the years visiting beaches around the world I have never seen this and ended up going back to the hotel via a tuc tuc and spent a fortune in the shopping mall.,1, December 2018
3147874,"Beautiful beach, rather busy during the high season (when we visited), but no to bad. Possibility to rent parasols and sun beds and some stands for drinks and fruit. Lots of restaurants across the street, offering take away. Not very well maintained, quite some waste lies around. Some Water sports are available. Watch out for sales people trying to pull time-share scams, mainly around the beach walk (or actually pavement next to the road).",3, December 2018
3147875,"Compared to the Patong beach, I really enjoy this one, not only for the unpolluted sea water but also for the full view of the sea.  Although I fought with my boyfriend here but I still love it:)",5, December 2018
3147876,"We are 4 persons in our family. Kids are 10 and 13. We want beaches that is not to crowded, no smell off boats or jetskis, no loud music. Then it is pretty ok as long as we spend our time away from the centre of the beach. There you can spend time with your kids and have fun. In the centre is more suited for people that is more in the party mood.",3, December 2018
3147878,"I am not very familiar with the beaches in Phuket. I usually never stay in Phuket. Karon Beach is a nice beach, we’ve been there around 5pm to see the sunset. There was some tourists but it was ok, the water is not clear but still ok.",4, December 2018
3147886,We visited this beach after visiting Big budda temple in Phuket. The beach is located on wide area so there many space for tourists. The sea itself is very clean and transparent. Our children were very happy to swim and play in very warm and clean water.,5, December 2018
3147888,"This beach is much quieter than Patong. However, there are still many many people, with normal activities such as jet skis etc. Beach is long, less people trying to sell you junk, overall quieter vibe. Lots of hotels and restaurants along the beach. Better place for families with kids.",4, December 2018
3147894,"Loved it. At First for the sand- unique, silk like, squizing under the feet.  One doesn't see it even in Kata. Clean turquoise waters, even though wavy. Perfect tropical greenery around and Big Budha visible, not overbuild as Patong and mist of the beaches. Serenity and beauty.",5, December 2018
3147896,"Karon lies between kata beach and patong beach.Its is a long beach, with soft sand, clear waters, and enough stalls for eating in drinking.Its not too filled with activities like patong, nor too quite like kata and kata noi.Its a family friendly area.Its a long beach so u can always find a secluded place to relax or swim.A nice beach to visit in phuket",4, November 2018
3147901,We actually loved this beach in comparison to Patong as it was with nicer crowds and fewer people. Worth staying here,5, October 2018
3147902,"Beautiful, soft, sandy beach, large enough to share with the public, no sunbeds allowed but take a towel or mat.",5, January 2018
3147903,"We have been travelling and holidaying in Thailand for 15yrs and our first time to Karon beach for a stay. Now we split our stays, half at Karon and half else where, great spot",4, June 2018
3147904,Karon beach is a nice and clean beach like most in Phuket. Accessibility is good and there is a wide variety of food and drink available at both street vendors and a group of restaurants close by. This is an excellent family beach with many families enjoying themselves on our visit. There are plenty of shallow areas for younger kids to play in and lifeguards are on duty most of the time. As with most beaches on this side of Phuket the water can be treacherous at certain times of the year so please heed all warnings.,4, December 2018
3147907,"Karon beach is clear sea, soft golden sand beautiful beach. Usual activities available. Food, and drinks all available",5, November 2018
3147908,Karon beach is very touristy but not in a bad way and certainly more family friendly than neighbouring Patong. The beach itself has lots of sunbeds and umbrellas as well as some quieter stretches.You are never far away from a cold drink or something to eat as across the road from the beach there are shops and restaurants galore.,4, December 2018
3147910,"Karon is one of the long beaches, maybe the longest in Phuket. It is not so crowded or popular like Patong but not so silent like Kata Beach area. Just in between. There are many nice hotels around, many good restaurants and cafes as well. People are swimming, para sailing, kite surfing and walking along the beach inviting you to joy. A beautiful sunset with yout loved ones will stay in the memories as you remember Phuket later.",5, November 2018
3147911,The best beach in Thailand - 2 mile long stretch of golden sand that's not completely covered in sun beds. Facing West so enjoys fantastic sunsets at 6.10pm - 6.40 pm depending on the time of year.,5, December 2018
3147918,Guess December is a right time to enjoy the white sand and amazing sea. The beach was not that crowded and we really enjoyed! Remember there are some planktons in the water and they can bite some time to time but still it was great!,5, December 2018
3147920,"We have been traveling around Thailand and not yet visited a beach on our trip. This is the first one that we have stumbled across, it's just like any other beach I suppose. We paid 200 baht for the sun loungers and grabbed 2 coconuts for 160 baht.There is people walking up and down asking if you want to buy anything from them which is annoying!There is also spots along the beach that have ski jets for hire or have a go on. Seemed expensive to me so I didn't use their service- 30mins 1600 baht for 2 people.At one point along the beach if you come from the lake side there is a row of cafes where the women in there shout you across the road to go and eat there which is also annoying.Other than that it was nice and clean.",4, December 2018
3147922,Watched sun set and then did morning  walk the next day. Quite popular Good for people watching.  Lots of swimmers,5, December 2018
3147923,this beach is fairly long but lacks any kind of cosy atmosphere there are some volley ball nets available for a quick game and there is a mini training area so someone has mad an effort but the traffic air pollution stench of open sewers and pooluted water bring it down this is now mainly a Russian area for tourists.   overpriced and poor quality goods.,2, December 2018
3147930,"Same-same. Recommend, if you like hot air in the room and cold water in the shower. Breakfast normal",5, December 2018
3147932,"if you want a bit more quieter than patong beach look no further, so peaceful, had 3 massages on the beach, lovely little bars and restaurants close by, brilliant day, sun loungers avaailabe",5, November 2018
3147933,Excellent beach with loungers availableSea cleanHumid in afternoonHot in sun feels like 35 degrees CGreat location plenty of roomShowers play areasExcellent street food market you can eat fantastic food very low prices with same for drinks. Try scorpion and worms etcJet ski hire Other sea extreme fun with speedboats etcDanger around these areas to swimmers not well marked off! Sad to see as in Europe this wouldn't happen.,5, December 2018
3147936,"While we were here we watched surf competitions that were held on the beach! It was great fun to watch men woman and children compete!The beach is busy with banana boats, jet skis rented as well as loads of places to buy food and drink! It was so hot when we visited, we had to find shade as the beach was too hot!Define this beach as busy and hip with something for everyone",4, December 2018
3147938,"Beautiful beach. The water was warm - we could swim morning, noon or evening.A lovely place with views of the Big Buddha. Small waves on the beach were perfect for children.",5, November 2018
3147939,"It is far from the hassle of patong. Ppl won't bug you on the street to get a business out of you. Street food is great and cheap. No inflated price for tourist as it is in bkk. Plenty of pubs around with live music. If you are looking for quiet and family friendly, that is the place",3, November 2018
3147942,"Best massage ever at Karon Beach, near the business south on the beach past the Hilton Hotel. Also some very fun shops easy access to food and ice cold water",5, November 2018
3147943,"Relatively clean beach, with good swimming and plenty of space, but not as picturesque as neighbouring Kata Beach. Lacks or with shopping and dining options",3, October 2018
3147944,We came here to get away from the hustle and bustle. Karon beach is good for doing just that. It can get crowded though and there are people there trying to scam you.,4, November 2018
3147945,"Recently stayed at Karon beach and a beautiful beach it is too! Water sports available,  shops,  restaurants etc. Well worth a visit and would come back!",5, November 2018
3147946,We did a long walk up and down this beach every day to try and burn off some of the holiday excesses. It is very beautiful and serene. No problem if you want to do something less energetic. Sunbeds with parasols are for rent and there is a series of restaurants at one end which are great. The sea is an incredible colour and calm enough to be able to bathe in.,4, November 2018
3147947,"We went here last month, very nice beach.  Lots of places to eat. Very relaxing time. Did not get bugged by vendors so that’s a plus",4, October 2018
3147948,"We arrived at the beach around 11:00 and had a great swim in the crystal clear waters and enjoyed the squeaky powdery sands We bought ourselves some fruit shakes on the beach at THB 50 each and was on our way to the ocean again, but the water was infested with garbage to the extent that we opted to pick up as much garbage as we could, packed up and went to Surin Beach instead. Not sure whether this is a common occurrence at Karon Beach?  Maybe we were just unlucky.",4, November 2018
3147951,"Recently booked a taxi service with Chicken. What a beautiful, genuinely happy and helpful man. If you want that little bit of extra “special service” then Chicken’s Taxi Service is what you want. He is your private tour guide and he also looks after you. His vehicle is spotless, inside and out. His rates are very reasonable too. He provided me with ice cold drinks and also ice cold face washers upon return to the vehicle. Those ice cold face washers were just what I needed in the hot humid climate. I did not expect any of this. Booked a taxi last year (2017) and received nothing like this. It’s those little things people do to make your adventure that bit more special and memorable. I will not forget Chicken. Chicken, thank you so very much! I hope you get that minivan you so desperately want - you deserve it! Keep up the great work! If you are looking for a taxi service then I would highly recommend Chicken.",5, November 2018
3147953,"We went during Loy Krathong, so it was a little more crowded than probably typical. But it was beautiful and the food and drinks nearby were very good. We got fried ice cream and walked along the shops; you didn't get bombarded by vendors like you do in Patong. Gorgeous sunset, only 200 baht for two beach chairs and an umbrella. If we had another day in Phuket I'd definitely go back!",4, November 2018
3147960,Totally amazing- just make sure you have a lot sunscreen not too full not too empty. The sand is perfect and you can rent an umbrella and sun-bedding for 200 for two people or all day ;) water is very warm in November,5, November 2018
3147964,Karon View Point is a popular viewpoint.Coral Island is a beautiful island with crystal clear water.,4, November 2018
3147966,Went on a scooter with a friend. A beautiful place and lots of places where you can relax. Went to Karon view point. A must see place. Awesome trip.,4, October 2018
3147968,"Visited beach before,June/July,all debris from storms in those months removes from beach.Sunbeds  and Brolley 200 bhts for the day £5.00.resturants only 60 yds from beach.beach cleared of rubbish every night,keep fit gym equipment available at both ends of beach.",5, November 2018
3147969,Nice beach and for 100 Bhat a bed you can’t complain!A good and friendly vibe and the beach and sea are gorgeous!,4, November 2018
3147970,"So clean, quieter than patong. We stayed in Novotel Karon which was awesome on its own.. Their facilities are excellent... Loved it.",5, November 2018
3147974,"Clean water,awesome parasailing, not crowded, very peaceful environment. This beach is surrounded by very good beach wear shops . Must do shopping here as same stuff is very reasonably priced compared to other beaches of Phuket",5, November 2018
3147975,"This beach was alot of fun, staying at Movenpik we visited several times. The beach is white sand and quite shallow.Down one end are rows and rows of deck chairs, in the middle are beach volley ball nets, and the furthest other end are rocks that you can climb on (a few metes high so not dangerous). You can higher jet skis (its hilarious watching a little bike pulling off these at the end of the day) and parasailing (both single and tandem). Cost of parasailing was about 300 baht for 2 of us. Plenty of food, shops, markets, taxis all along the beach front.",5, April 2018
3147979,"This beach is highly recommended. This beach is clean and the views are beautiful.  If in phuket, I would highly recommend Karon or Kata.",4, November 2018
3147980,3 of us stayed in the middle of karon beach 10 mins in each direction and your pretty well. Covered. Plenty of bars restaurants and places to buy your bits and bobs. The beach is long and the sand is fine. It's close enough to patong without being in the mix and madness that comes along with it.,4, November 2018
3147981,"Karon beach was cross the road from our hotel. Clean water and sandy beach, no rocks under your feet which was beautiful to walk on. The under water photo was about 20 meters from beach and 2-3 meters deep. I went around 12, nice waves to swim in. The water was very clean no seaweed or fish, just clear sand. Excellent to practice snorkelling. There are a number of restaurants nearby for drinks or lunch. There is also a nigh market near the lake, selling pancakes, fried ice cream, fruits and fried bugs. Different beach to Patong, more space and less commercialised.",5, November 2018
3147984,This is a gorgeous beach where you quickly feel like a local living in paradise. The water is clear and clean. It is small enough to not feel overwhelmed by the crowds but large enough to have all the choice of activities,5, November 2018
3147985,A really inviting beach to visit. The water is warm and clear. Take mask and snorkel lots of things to see under the sea,5, November 2018
3147987,Good beach with a decent swell of waves to make it fun. Not a lot of things in the water pretty much just sand. Nice sunsets too.,5, November 2018
3147988,"Very clean and nice beach, water looks crystal clear and blue, I am so impressed, lovely. Amazing ...",5, November 2018
3147989,"I guess this one of the top three beach’s in Phuket, very clean and safe, didn’t see any jellyfish at all and it can be used for surfing (beginner), lots of great restaurants along the beach road and for me it was the best sea food restaurant compared to Patong and Kamala in both quality and Price wise.",5, November 2018
3147991,"First things first its hot so sun block is a must even for dark skinned people. you will thank me later believe me . always make sure to take a back pack with water ,sun block and a cap .the back pack is for carry you food ,drinks and towel to the beach and in case you buy any new stuff its just easier than carrying lots of small packets...make sure to choose a nice spot on the beach with deckchairs it makes a differences. the sandy shore is so nice and the water is warm with decent gentle waves perfect for swimming...make sure to stay hydrated, street food and stalls and shop a close by . will definitely return again.",5, October 2018
3147994,"Very busy, deckchairs and parasols all along the beach. Sand pathway along the top was a bit grubby. Nice to feel the sand between your toes then head back to the hotel for a swim!",3, November 2018
3147996,"When me and my family go to the beach they’d all go to the beach and I’d walk off to the nearest headland to practice my bagpipes. My wife is a beach widow!Then things have changed. I first came to Karon beach, almost as a random choice. I’ve had a ‘Damascus Road’ experience.Today I bought a dry bag from the local shop. Stuffed my clothes in the bag and swam the whole length of the beach towing my stuff behind. This is the third day running.It’s a popular venue but there’s enough space to get some quiet. Long white sand which crunches under your feet like the sound of flour or custard being pressed, clear lapping water, water sports, beach massage, cheap food, very little loud music, family friendly... need a say more!And then there’s the sunsets. I think the Creator tripped up when making the sunsets here and left a large dollop of his (or her) glory. Every evening I’ve sat on the sand and been awed by the west facing view of the closing day. It’s a must for your trip, and a free show. First time I saw it there were tears in my eyes.However, be aware of a couple of thingsFirstly the beach road is busy, so kids particularly will need watching.Secondly, the largest proportion of visitor seems to be Russian.They’re friendly enough but it was another significant culture to get the measure of on my holiday. I’ve found myself latching onto every English speaking conversation I can.So. Please don’t tell anyone about this place, we don’t want too many people to share it with us. The bagpipes have failed to make an appearance and I’m writing this review with crinkled fingers from too much water!",5, November 2018
3147998,"Karon Beach features the third-longest beach on Phuket Island. Located on the west coast, between Patong to the north and Kata to the south, Karon Beach is the one of the most popular holiday destinations in Phuket. The beach itself has excellent snorkelling (and even diving) spots at its southern end and is wide enough for beachgoers to never feel crowded.",5, October 2018
3147999,"Karon Beach itself was a place where I just found myself soaking up the sun & just doing absolutely nothing for hours at a time. To be able to waste away the day looking at the ocean or swimming in it, was what I found to be so relaxing & helped to forget about my everyday life back home.",4, October 2018
3148000,"Not as busy as expected and plenty sunbeds/umbrellas available.  Staff were very helpful in obtaining extra beds when required.Great fun dodging the waves in the water, but not for the faint hearted.  I would imagine this can be quite dangerous on some occasions.",5, October 2018
3148005,Staying at Kata but wondered out for the day.To hot to sunbathe so walked along the waters edge.A beautiful and quiet beach. The sun loungers and shade were 100b each. A bit dear if you are only planning on staying for an hour or so.Enjoyed our afternoon,5, November 2018
3148009,"Wenn wir in Thailand sind, verbringen wir 70% unserer Beachzeit auf dem Karon Beach.Dadurch das er so lang ist findet man immer ein ruhigen Platz.Und das Knirschen des Sandes unter den Füssen ist einmallig:)))))",5, January 2018
3148011,"Karon beach is a very nice and clean beach. best place to spend the evening. For those who don't like the crowded patong beach, karon offers the best option.Lots of drinking and eating option nearby",4, January 2018
3148012,Would recommend this Resort to Families. Great Food and very friendly staff. Rooms were clean and spacious.Thanks,5, October 2018
3148013,"It is more comfy compared to Phuket Beach for me who prefer beach which are have quiet and calm atmosphere, no enterance ticket, white sand, and good people.",4, June 2018
3148014,We were stayin at central villa s but used facilities at sister hotel central grand which is on the beautiful Karon beach with clear warm sea and waves lapping the shoreline fantastic,4, October 2018
3148016,Lovely beach. It was very busy. One cannot underestimate the rip currents even though the sea looks calm. One can spend a relaxing day on a beach loungers offered for 100 baht each. Jetskis can be hired and you can go parasailing. Out hotel was across the road from the beach which was very convenient,4, October 2018
3148017,bit choppy but if walk further on really nice and calm watching lizards coming out of trees eating crabs of the rocks would deffo hire a bed as sand has a lot of flies but really enjoyed it sea is like a warm bath loved it,5, October 2018
3148019,Walked down to Karon Beach from our hotel and just took in the sunsets every night. Some lovely scenes as you watch the sun go down and then see the sky light up in orange and red colours.,4, October 2018
3148020,"We have been to Phuket 5 times and stayed at Karon Beach every time.  It's been about 3 years since our last trip but it seems to have gone downhill and become a bit more daggy and cheap.Other beach areas seems to have added some nicer places in terms of food, massage and other things but Karon just has added not much and what's new is just more cheap food places and daggy looking massage shops.  Having said that there are a couple good places to eat and fantastic resorts.There are nice beaches and it's small and easy to walk around.  It's a fun place like most of these beach areas but I wouldn't go back there .. If you haven't been there it's worth a try, just not for us.",3, October 2018
3148021,"It's such a clean, nice beach . We had an amazing time here. One of the very few beaches where I really enjoyed being present.",5, October 2018
3148022,Karon beach was right across the road from the Movenpick resort. It is not crowded and many families were enjoying the water. Parasailing is available and other activities. The beach was clean and not too busy.,4, October 2018
3148023,There are basically no restaurants or hotels directly in the beach so it look wild and is peaceful. It's a great place to go for relax.,5, October 2018
3148024,"With the temperature in the high twenties, humidity in the 70s, warm water and quiet, clean beaches, the northern end of Karol Beach is ideal in the early morning. The many Russian families with young children bear testimony to the calm, safe conditions that can prevail. We have breakfast early (before 7h30), then head down in the coolness of the morning. As most businesses only open at 9 or 10, the beach, like the village, is very peaceful before 10. Ideal for a beach stroll to the southern end and refreshing dips along the way should you need it.",5, October 2018
3148025,"This is a near 'pristine' beach. We visited both Kata and  Karon beach and have to say Karon was much quieter than Kata beach, although it could have been just a coincidence. The beach was pretty clean and the sand was lovely. Compared to Patong Beach, I would say Karon beach trumps. Would definitely go back",5, August 2018
3148027,"Lovely beach, lots of activities available. Beautiful sunsets, makes for a good photo opportunity. Could have more bins.",5, October 2018
3148028,Thai best tailor in karon beach phuket is Tony and Raj at malla tailors very friendly and helpful great experience,5, October 2018
3148031,"This beach is perfect for a long early morning walk.   It’s a lot better then kata beach and cleaner. Best time is to walk at 6am before it gets hot and busy.The local government need to put more bins and ensure regular cleaning,Tourists need to also be respectful and thrown rubbish away in bins or take back to hotel to dispose of.",5, October 2018
3148032,"very nice and long gold beach ,with a lot of restaurants in front of the beach,you can see a lot of   people in beach  .when you walking on the sand ,you can hear snow sounds under your walking,,",4, July 2018
3148035,"Karon beach was disappointing for the simple fact that it was very dirty. Not sure where the trash comes from, I am assuming from being washed up on shore. Nonetheless, it was a challenge to find a “good” spot to lay down as I didn’t feel comfortable surrounded by so much garbage.Has potential to be a great beach, but I’d be hard pressed to find anyone who would argue Karon beach is clean.",2, October 2018
3148042,"Firstly I am spoiled with some beautiful striden beaches where I live, however karon Beach is a pleasant stretch of Beach which is scattered with palm trees and other local trees.There are areas with seating and umbrellas and the water is a constant warm temperature.As the sun goes down you can get some spectacular photographs of some beautiful sunsets.",3, October 2018
3148043,Ideal for walks and swimming. Water sports also done in the central and end section but plenty of area for any type of activity,5, October 2018
3148044,"This beach is polluted. There are plastic bottles / plastic bags / sigarette buds everywhere and a lot of trash washes up by the tides. It was really disheartening to see this (and people were adding to it by leaving their trash on the beach). Lots of activities to do (for a price of course) like banana boat, jetski, parasailing, etc. There are also vendors but they don't really push you to buy something.",3, October 2018
3148046,Definitely one of the more quiet beach optios in Phuket. Plenty of restaurants and markets as well as a children's play area with swings and slides. Many salons offering Thai massage and mani-pedis. Parasailing available from the beach.,5, October 2018
3148047,"Love Phuket, but most of all love Karon beach people around are so friendly too. Definitely come back again",5, October 2018
3148048,"Estuvimos alojados en Karon Beach, pero nuestra estancia no era para pasar días de playa, sino para disfrutar de Phuket y sus alrededores. La playa es bonita, amplia (2,5 kilómetros de longitud) pero con el hándicap de que casi siempre tiene unas condiciones de baño complicadas…",3, July 2018
3148053,nice beach full of activities Parasailing lots people swimming  sunbathing  just need to swim between flags,4, October 2018
3148054,"The beach is nice, easy to walk to shops, restaurants, massages etc. Chairs and umbrellas available...I think for a cost.",5, October 2018
3148055,No one to disturb you trying to sell stuff. Work your tan just loke the rest of the mini crowd and absolutely clean beach.,5, October 2018
3148057,Karon beach is quiet and peaceful. Not a lot of people around at this time of year. Some great food places and massage places Altho many not willing to barter on price. Not sure if because it was low season. 400 baht one way to Patong which eats into your budget if you want to go there often,4, October 2018
3148062,We popped by for awhile in the late morning and early afternoon and it was packed. Karon was one of the popular beaches in Phuket but certainly better than Patong beach in many levels. We went back again during sunset and it was beautiful.,4, September 2018
3148065,Nice place to go for beach swimming as the sea is flat unlike other beach in Phuket. And the beach is so long. Along the way there are many restaurants by the beach.,5, October 2018
3148066,"I spent two weeks at Karon Beach, staying at Best Western. It's a beautiful time of year, the monsoon season has finished with just a few days of clouds and tropical showers and many beautiful sunny days at the perfect temperature. There are many good places to eat, the Temple Market to visit, the big Buddha is close by.The beach itself is beautiful with many nationalities enjoying the sun and Para Gliding from the sand. Swim between the flags as there are many rips that occur quickly as the sand banks change.",4, September 2018
3148067,"Karon beach is underrated by many. Beautiful white sand beach that stretches for kilometers. Popular during June, July, and August. Good restaurants and markets. Watersports for great views.",4, September 2018
3148069,"A beautiful beach with lots of activities for all ages.  The water is pristine and the beach is clear of plastics and pollutions.Usual Thai sellers of massage, henna, braids and beer available. Really worth going to.",4, September 2018
3148070,"The beach was lovely, but I got bitten or stung by something, all over my chest and tummy.I broke out in an irritating, nasty rash the next day.",4, September 2018
3148071,"Dirty full of rubbish,  very disappointing. Would not go again. The town wasn't mucn better either, dirty place.",1, September 2018
3148072,Beautiful beach in Karon. The beach is very well kept and clean. Many shops and restaurants within walking distance.,5, August 2018
3148073,"This is easily the best beach we went to on our trip. Clean, well looked after, and didn't have 300 boats crowding the water. We didn't have to swim in designated blocks either. Highly recommend this!",5, May 2018
3148074,"We stayed across the road and I tried to swim st beach daily.The Beach is clean with fine sand and the water was clean ad well.It had lifeguards with swim areas that were clearly marked with flags, but I chose to swim outside the flags without any problems. A nice beach away from the crowds of Patong beach.Also had pay for use beach chairs.",5, September 2018
3148076,"We stayed in Kata but went to Karon beach many times , just like Kata beach they are clean and worth the walk",5, August 2018
3148078,"I stayed at Mandarava Resort and Spa. I bit far from shopping area - 15 mins walk!! to the city of Karon Beach.  Good though after massive food.Nice beach. Something stung me when I swam at the beach.  It is a bit annoying.Lots of local food, and BBQ my favourite!",5, September 2018
3148079,One of Phuket's nicer beaches.Popular with Russians.I enjoyed swimming here every day. Easy access and it even had an outdoor exercise area. It had lifesavers patrolling the beach but I had reservations if they were qualified.Jetskiing and parasailing are on offer. The beach & ocean was clean unlike with many beaches in Asia today.,4, September 2018
3148081,Had a WONDERFUL day here today. Not too crowded. Nice clean beach. Vendors renting lounges for about $3 US each including umbrella. Cold drinks nearby. Massage ladies here were fantastic!  1 hour massage for 400 Baht ($12 US)  definitely recommend.,5, September 2018
3148084,"Had a great time relaxing and sightseeing, Karon beach is a good spot with plenty of restaraunts, shopping and bars.Easy access to a lot of tourist things. great area to stay.",4, September 2018
3148085,I did my morning beach runs here and it was a beautiful beach! Enjoyed it very much. Amazing statue and very close to where I was staying in Kata,5, September 2018
3148086,"Karon Beach Area is a lovely spot, with lots of markets and restaurants, everything is in walking distance, great holiday spot",5, September 2018
3148089,"Karon Beach is a beautiful area, and is a lot quieter than it's neighbouring Patong.Huge selection of hotels and restaurants. Great for the family.",5, September 2018
3148090,Karon Beach is quieter than Patong.  The red flags are up this time of year due to rough seas which can quickly change for the worse when rain fronts come through.  Did not see any lifeguards on duty which didn't worry some from taking a dip.,4, September 2018
3148091,Love the beach at karon as compared to Patong or Kata. Much quiet for a beach holiday. Sand is clean and make sure you book hotels opposite beach so is easier to access the beach,4, September 2018
3148093,"Karon Beach is typically not as popular as Kata Beach, for example, because of the rip tides and the fact that it is a lot rougher. However, if a not-so-busy beach is your thing and you prefer to bodysurf a few waves rather than swim at a beach where there is hardly any movement in the water, then Karon Beach is your spot!More than enough life guards on duty who keep a close and active eye on bathers, blowing their whistles when anyone drifts outside of the flags.It was our favourite beach at Phuket.",4, September 2018
3148096,"My husband and I while walking along the beach front shops of Karon was pulled aside by a man with a stall selling clothing and the back of his shop lead out to a dam where you can go with your child or self and catch and release fish.The entrance was very ordinary, I would say work in progress. We were asked to follow further and were shown tanks with large fish in them that are in the dam you could possibly catch.Then handed a brochure no business name anywhere or signs as such which I have taken a photo of. Photos of Fathers and son holding caught fish.Map on the back and phone number on front.Needing a lot of work maybe good if desperate to fish on a budget.Worth a visit if you have children Definately not as glamorous as the flyer.But share just the same.",2, September 2018
3148097,"I would recommend staying here if you want a quiet beach holiday, enough going on to keep me happy, not as crazy as Patong beach by any means.  The sand and swimming are great.",5, May 2018
3148102,Great Indian restaurant in Phuket town just off Bangla roadGreat variety of Indian dishes with a great taste and low price.  Pleasant customer service who are willing to cook to your taste like excluding onion and garlic of their dishes to make them for Jain Indian eating.,5, August 2018
3148103,My husband and I are staying in a resort hotel across the road Karon Beach. Karon Beach has a long expand of beach with the usual umbrellas etc. Good for swimming or just flexing out. Approx 20 mins by car to Patong. A more relaxed and friendly atmosphere. We are active senior travellers.,4, September 2018
3148104,Quieter side of Phuket but ideal for holiday. We really enjoyed our stay - people are super friendly. Great for people wanting a beach resort holiday. Highly geared for tourists. Suggest you look for the bars/food stalls etc off the beaten track.,5, September 2018
3148105,We arrived from krabi by mini van .. they asked for extra mony to drop us at the hotel and when we refused the drop us at the karon center .. tuk tuk and taxi advantage coz of the luggage ..  and they raised the price they asked for 200 baht for two minutes drive to hotel ..,2, September 2018
3148106,Karon is nice. not as crowed as Patong. still it has rubbish everywhere on beach as it is wet season. warning if riding scooter - make sure you have internstional drivers licence and wearing helmet as you will be pulled over by police. if u dont have licence and helmet u will be fined. also be prepared for bag search.,4, September 2018
3148108,We have been to Thailand several times and always choose to stay at Karon Beach as it is not the hustle and bustle like Patong is. The beach is not over crowded plenty of room and an pleasant walk. Only have to cross the road for shopping and places to eat also there are places along the beach area to rest and enjoy the view.,5, April 2018
3148112,"we were just on the beach a couple of times but it is really nice,you have to rent your sunbed(a couple of pound) and bring your own towel but we found it worth while you do get bothered by street vender,s but a polite no is enough,you can only swim in between certain flags because of the tidal current but it is patrolled at all times by lifeguards",5, August 2018
3148114,"The worst thing that happened to Karon Beach in recent years was the removal of the beach chairs and umbrellas, this left beach goers with no shelter and removed a basic reason to go to the beach, There is nothing more pleasant than lounging on a sunlounge under an umbrella, and an occasional dip in the tepid tropical waters. Karon beach is fabulous, fine wide sand turquoise water and it is never crowded as it is so long. However the beach chairs are back, In my estimation they were gone for about 3 years, but at the end of August 2018 they were there.. For 100b around $4 AUD or $3 USD you get to use one for all day, I believe karon is one of the better beaches in the world and it is a personal favorite of mine. The water is clean, the foreshore is not too bad although not totally pristine and it is easy to access.",5, August 2018
3148115,Even had massages on the beach! Plenty to do but not so good for swimming. Windsurfing was flat out with 3 boats going all the time,5, August 2018
3148116,The town of Karon is geared for tourists and we were there in low season. We headed to Kata beach for some quiet but were touted constantly whilst there. There's great night markets on Tuesday and Friday nights with food stalls and loads of everything else.,2, September 2018
3148117,"Relatively nice beach. Cleaner and less crowded than Patong beach. Less peddlers harassing you by selling items.Along the stretch of beach, the other side of the road is lined with stores selling food and items, as well as resorts.",4, August 2018
3148118,"We initially went at low tide near the Patak road huge round about and the beach was ok however in August you cannot really swim in this beach as there are too many rips. So it was just nice for the kids to make sand castles.Then one day on the way back from Dino Mini Golf at the other end of the beach we decided to walk along the entire beach and noticed that it was just awful at high tide.  There was so much rubbish washed onto the beach that we have never seen anything like this before.   There were hundreds of the following; lighters, broken flip flops, tiny bits of plastic, styrofoam, straws, timber etc.  And at high tide trying to avoid this rubble passing through my feet as the tide came in at noon was disgusting.If the Thailand government are keen on keeping its tourism industry intact it should pay to clean up this beach!  We will be trying a new tropical country next year.",2, August 2018
3148120,"Very Nice beach, with some waves and a lot of people. Some garbage laying around though, which should have been cleaned up before everything ends in the Ocean.",3, March 2018
3148124,"Karon beach lovely place, lots and lots of places to eat and shop. People are friendly but a little pushy to sell their goods",5, August 2018
3148126,"A nice, long sandy beach but there are only a few fast food makers and something else. (In Kata beach there are more.) In the water something pinch in the water...maybe jelly fish",3, March 2018
3148127,"Took a tuk tuk from patong which is 400 Bhat each way , 2 sumloungers 100 Bhat each and chilled for a few hours , had a nice relaxing day plenty of restaurants and shops around",4, August 2018
3148129,"Any Portuguese beach and far superior to karon, the hotels do not have beds of beach nor bars, the beach is dirty and full of people to propose taxis or other businesses. If you are in a good resort as was my case (Hotel Mövenpick Resort & Spa Karon Beach...a Eden in Karon Beach) do not leave the Hotel, get yourself by the pool the beach is not worth it. Karon is only a good base for tours to the Phi Phi Islands and James Bond Island  from ( 1h from the Marina but the tours pick you up in Hotel for free). Phuket can have good beaches, Karon is not one of them ... if you like a quieter, clean beach go to Khao Lak or to the lesser known islands as Phi Phi are full of people. See @magdabolinhas or youtube Magda Bolinhas video and you have some idea",2, August 2018
3148130,"Nice surf beach. Patrolled swimming areas. Waves and rips a plenty. Opportunity to jet ski, para sail and banana boat. Rent umbrellas and lounges for 200bt   Hawkers selling ice creams, corn, clothes and trinkets. Across the road is Karon which offers plenty of food options , pharmacies, groceries and stalls. A nice way to spend the day or there are some shadytrees",4, August 2018
3148136,We visited the beach in the day and night with the family. It’s August so almost their winter season the tied is a little rough and the waves will move you about quite a bit. The sand is golden and lovely to walk on.,5, August 2018
3148140,Staying  at Beyond  Resort Karon. On Monday afternoon  while  enjoying  the  pool  area  we had  the most  horrific sight  of watching  a unfortunate tourist  be swept  out to  see and drowning. Local  life  guards  to their  credit  tried  to reach  this poor  man  but  with  limited  resources  and  dangerous  surf failed .Please  be careful  as this a Dangerous  beach.,4, August 2018
3148141,The beach was OK but seemed a bit dilapidated. Not much going on there with no parasailing or surfboards or boogie boards for hire.,3, August 2018
3148143,"Karon Beach is long and covered in golden sand. Perfectly blue water and palm trees. It looks like the perfect beach. It is a very clean beach.Karon sand is very course so be prepared. Make sure you swim through the flags. The beach front, before you get onto the beach, isn't as clean so stick to the proper walk ways. There is exercise equipment along the foreshore.One thing I will warn you about is the guys on motor bikes who pull up and try to engage you in conversation, they seem nice but they are trying to get you to a time share presentation. They will give you a card and you will win something, old story. At the end of our trip we just had fun with them and numbered them, on one walk six different guys tried to talk to us we just laughed and said ""you are number six"" they are usually dressed in white shirts and ride mopeds. Very easy to spot. Be nice but don't fall for it.",4, August 2018
3148144,"I am stay in the karon beach Grand sunset resort, which opposite karon beach.when i went is Aug 18. the wave on the beach is strong, a lot of tourist are dare not to play in the beach. But the water is blue ,weather is nice with sunny, and good view for sunset. In the weekend i went, the beach activity is off, but when Monday is on , the activity such as jet ski, volley ball, parasail,and so on.",5, August 2018
3148145,I loved this beach husband a daughter had a go on the jet ski they loved it. Lovely calm sea and really warm price of sunbeds a little expensive but worth it to keep shaded as was roasting hot. Missing this beach as visited 2 years running will return really soon,5, May 2018
3148148,"For such a beautiful location the beach I’m sorry to say was the most polluted iv ever seen , fishing nets , micro plastic all over the beach and coming in with every wave , one day there were big blobs of crude oil , all the way down the beach , another day we counted 30+ dead puffer fish very sad",1, August 2018
3148149,"If you are in Karon Beach for the evening I recommend a stop off at the Sutin bar , on the main road , live music every night .and as always the girls are very friendly .",5, July 2018
3148150,I visited in monsoon season. The sea was quite rough. There was a small designated swim area where the lifeguards were on top form.  The waves were so much fun.  The beach was always quite quiet in my opinion. Extremely clean with restaurants and bars a couple of minutes away.  Vendors not pushy. I loved it.,5, August 2018
3148155,"We thoroughly enjoyed our days spent lazing on this near 'pristine' beach. The beach was clean with clearly marked trashcans for tourists to dump their trash, ice cold drinks and ice cream can be bought from vendors operating along the beach and activities are abound for those that are into those sort of things. The beach has designated swimming areas that are strictly enforced by the lifeguards on duty we felt really safe waddling about the water and playing on the beach. Compared to Patong Beach, I would say Karon beach trumps.",5, August 2018
3148156,We visited in monsoon season so the sea had a lot of waves and no swim zones. However a lot of people were braving it. Kata beach was slightly less rough. A great beach though which is cleaned every morning. Nice for jogging and sunbathing.,4, August 2018
3148157,"Great beach, unfortunately during July/ August the tides are high.Less beach activities no swimming allowed as it too dangerous.",3, August 2018
3148161,This is a very nice beach that usually has very calm water which is usually quite warm. The beach chairs and umbrellas are a little bit expensive considering you are in Thailand. When we were there there were mostly Eastern Europeans that were very polite and courteous. The only time he got noisy is when people were taking off on the jet ski. Looking forward to go back again soon.,5, April 2018
3148166,Nicer beach than Patong not so crowed.Has nice sand and seems to be very clean.Just accross the road from shops and eating areas.,5, July 2018
3148167,"I was very disappointed at the filth on this beach. Washed up plastic, dirty beach with nobody cleaning up. Water was brown and it is a very busy beach.",3, July 2018
3148169,Went parasailing on the beach which was fantastic until you could see the sewage going into the ocean. Turned us off and we stuck to the hotel pool.,3, July 2018
3148170,Beach was a short walk from our hotel.  We paid 200 baht for 2 chairs and an umbrella plenty of room for the 7 of us to sit on.  The sand and water was lovely and it was nice to relax there. You do get the occasional person selling things but once you say no they politely leave.  There are restaurants opposite so nice place to visit.,5, June 2018
3148171,"This was our first visit to Phuket and we were excited to be staying so close to the beach however we were very disappointed.    The beach itself would be beautiful if tidied up,  the rubbish is unbelievable.  We picked up handfuls each time we walked along but the rubbish bins were very few and far between which won’t be helping the situation.  Twice we picked up large chunks of broken glass, if someone had stood on it they would have been in trouble.  We did not swim at the beach due to the mess.  Such a shame the local hotels/resorts and government who are benefitting from tourists dollars don’t pitch in and clean up.  I’d rather pay a little more to stay there if it helped in cleaning up the space, such a beautiful place it seems a waste not to mention the poor sea life!",1, July 2018
3148174,Very nice beach side area; great hotels and restaurants. People are lovely and the beach is way less crowded than some others (that may be different in high season). Close to many popular tourist sightseeing areas.,5, July 2018
3148176,"Relaxing, away from the madness of Patong. Beach umbrellas and chairs are set up, beachgoers can hire an umbrella and 2 chairs at 200 baht for the day. Vendors walk around selling ice cream, corn on the cob, beach garb, but are not persistent. Lifeguards on duty. Little fish easily spotted swimming close to where the waves break. Jetskis for hire available, as well as parasailing.Seafood restaurants just across the road, but no halaal options available. Most places serve alcohol, even those listed as halaal. On the beach, there are a few setups selling coconuts, drinks, etc. Worth a visit.",4, July 2018
3148178,"Pretty nice beach , with chairs and umbrellas for rent, lots of tour desks, shops, restaurants around with amazing fresh seafood. You can find anything you might forget here from sunscreen to authentic souvenirs, pharmacies with their local cosmetics, I bought a lot))) Nice and quiet compared with busy Patong beach",4, July 2018
3148180,Good for families and cheaper than Patong. Not far by Tuk Tuk to other places. Water at the beach was nice and warm and no one hassling you,4, July 2018
3148182,We are staying in Karon at the moment. We have been here a week and not once has the beach been swimmable. It is nice from a distance but a heavy shore break. There is not a lot to do unless you have a nice pool to sit around so its worth ensuring your resort has that.,3, July 2018
3148186,Nice beach.too waves for swim for small kids Charged to use table and  chairsNice view and will come back,1, July 2018
3148187,"This beach has plenty of reasonable priced deck chairs and umbrellas,the beach is very clean,but whilst on our holiday,rainy season I think,strong winds and tides created damaged palm trees and debris all over,as we were leaving,it appeared that all the debris was being piled up ready for collection.many bars and restaurants within 60yds..",5, June 2018
3148189,Lots of rubbish on the beaches just made it look and feel dirty. Lots of water activities for the thrill seekers.,3, July 2018
3148190,Plenty of white sand to walk upon & much less crowded than other beaches surrounding it. Has a variety of shops nearby & plenty of food options. Well worth a look & a walk along.,4, July 2018
3148191,Very Sad to walk along this lovely Beach and see so much Rubbish and Plastic.The views from the Hotel were beautiful Though.,4, July 2018
3148192,When the rainy season arrives this beautiful beach can become very dangerous. We were here in May and June. In May it was a beautiful beach with lovely waves. A few days into June and the waves became very choppy and a lot more powerful and unpredictable.,5, June 2018
3148193,"The beach isn't overly high quality. Cleaner than Pattaya but as a beach 75% of Australian beaches are cleaner, have better surf life saving and better surfing. I didn't come all the way to Phuket to go to a beach. Byron Bay (Australia)  is only 3 hour's drive from me. The Gold Coast about the same. I did come here for what the beach brings with it. Asian beach culture. Asian beach towns and culture are totally different to any other beach cultures I've seen around the world. So don't come for the surf and sand here - fly to Australia for their beaches. Come here because the culture is unique, great entertainment and have a terrific atmosphere.",2, July 2018
3148195,Beautiful park next to the beach. Try the cold coconut drink- just delicious! The sea is rough with huge waves! Lovely to just walk on the beach. Watch for beautiful sunset.,5, July 2018
3148199,"Beautiful serene area, ocean view is amazing, great views its a definite must see its will leave you breathless.",5, June 2018
3148203,Nearest beach to Patong but away quieter and much more pristine in water colour. Enough waves to enjoy when swell is on. Beach break. Close proximity to Patong but none of the hustle and bustle if the quieter Phuket beach is what you’re after.,5, June 2018
3148207,Stayed at Novotel Phuket Karon and the beach was just opposite the hotel... The beach is not very crowded and while the cleanliness is good. You can also do water sports and there is a row of sun deck for you to tan if you want to. Restaurants and massage places is also near to the beach.,4, July 2018
3148208,"Another terrible beach, average in the low season, absolutely terrible during the high season, crowded of tourist and nothing special at all. Avoid",2, July 2018
3148209,"Came to Karon after visiting Kata Noi and Nai Harn, both very beautiful but different. Kata Noi and Nai Harn are smaller, and more private. Karon is longer and more populated. I liked that it was so long because I enjoy long walks on the beach.The main reason I came was to play volleyball. I didn't realize at first that 3 of the 4 courts were brought and set up by locals. Only one of them is permanently there and it's not a very high-quality net. The locals were reluctant to let me play, as they should've been because I'm an indoor player :) Don't expect to just jump on the court. Met some other young travelers that I played with too.After playing for a little, I watched the sunset, which was really pretty.There were people flying in the sky harnessed to parachutes, which looked fun. They were anchored in the ground, not being towed by boats. Not sure if this is still called parasailing.",5, June 2018
3148210,Best beach in Phuket is karon beach is so beautiful and amazing beach and a round the street alot of coffee and restaurants,5, July 2018
3148212,I have been to Thailand many times now and recommend Karon Beach for swimming and snorkeling.  Its clean and clear water offers an uninterrupted swimming experience.,5, May 2018
3148213,"Very good beach , clean and quiet place . Also can enjoy the activities like water sport and parasailing.",4, June 2018
3148214,Daha sakin patong beach e kiyasla. Ama sadece 20 tl ye patong beach e 24 saat erisim imkani. Taksiye ederim...,4, June 2018
3148216,"We stayed in Karon most of the time since it’s less busy than Patong. The Karon beach is not crowded so you can have some time to yourself just sit there and relax. If you stay in Karon area, I would recommend you to go there either in the morning or afternoon to just enjoy the sunshine and breeze at the beach to recharge yourself.️️ You can hire a chair or do some water activities, all up to you.",5, May 2018
3148217,We stayed at one of the hotels just on this beach during our phuket vacation. So we were on this beach every day during our 9 days vacation. You can take a lovely walk while enjoy any kind of water sports such as jet ski or parasailing. Or just have fun with the waves.,5, June 2018
3148219,We moved to Karon Beach after three days in Patong (Patong the town with a pong!) Here we stayed at the Andaman Seaview Hotel. This is a truly lovely hotel with the friendliest staff ever.The beach at Karon is amazing. 3.5km of fine white sand that squeaks when you walk on it. The sea is clean and warm and there are gentle swells even at high tide. We were able to bob around in the sea for hours on end.We hired loungers and an umbrella every day from one of the vendors who were also very friendly. We got to know the vendor quite well and he was amazing. Every day we would leave our towels and hotel basket at our lounger while we went to lunch. Everything was still there on our return. One day t started raining while we were at lunch and the vendor packed up our belongings and moved them under cover until we returned.We were at Karon out of season so it was not too crowded. Lots of families were on the beach which was nice to see.This is definitely a beach to return to.,5, May 2018
3148221,I'm sure this was amazing before people came along and ruined it with rubbish. Sea was  quite rough when we were there,3, June 2018
3148222,It's hard to surf here and it was pretty rough in June. It also had a lot of washed up rubbish along it that would be better if the locals focussed on removing the debris and not allowing it to wash back into the ocean,5, June 2018
3148223,"The beach is super peaceful and differently for people who enjoy peace. It is a great place to families and beautiful to be at, amazing way to spend your time and get the much needed me time",4, June 2018
3148224,Karon Beach is another best beaches on the western coastline of Phuket island. The place is good for sunbathing and water sports. The Massage parlour opposite the beaches are a must go.,4, May 2018
3148225,"We went during low season. High tide. Rent a pair of beach chairs. Enjoyed the view. Lovely beach with sports activities, parasailing, jet ski, on beach massage, as well as drink stall",5, June 2018
3148226,Nothing spectacular about this 3km long beach.You may get some beds for rent. Water is clean. Good for a swim if you don't want a super crowded beach.,4, June 2018
3148230,"Really sad to walk along this rubbish filled beach. I'm not sure where it comes from but the planet can not sustain people tipping there landfill into the ocean. Sand is golden colour, decent surf to swim in but we didn't swim in it properly as no lifeguards around and because of the rubbish.",2, June 2018
3148232,"Beautiful long golden sandy beach with plenty of shaded areas to relax under, very peaceful as not to many tourists.",4, May 2018
3148234,"We visited the Karon Beach area in early June, right at the start of the monsoon season. The sea was very rough every day due to offshore storms. An enormous amount of driftwood and trash floated ashore and despite the local community’s best effort to manage it, every day brought dozens more tree trunks and discarded fishing nets making swimming very dangerous. Pay attention to the signs on the beach. The locals told us that dozens of inexperienced tourists drown every year because they can’t read the currents. If there is a sign on the beach telling you not to enter the water, don’t!",3, June 2018
3148235,Beach was full of rubbish and wood from broken down trees.There is no way you could swim there. Beach was closed every day we were there. I'm guess it was because of the debris on the beach and in the water.,1, June 2018
3148238,This was our first experience with Thailand beach.  It was just perfect!  The water was a beautiful blue/green and very clean/clear.  I appreciated the little bit more of a quieter atmosphere than Patong Beach.,5, May 2018
3148239,"If you dont want the husstle and bustle of Patong then this is the place to stay. Juust 10min out of Patong. Lovely clean uncrowded beach, great restaurants and bars and massage parlours at reasonable prices.",5, June 2018
3148240,"If you're looking for a location to stay in Thailand, Karon Beach is my recommendation. Beautiful beach, shops & restaurants without the craziness you get in Patong. Everything you need is within walking distance - and Patong is only a 20 minute tuk-tuk ride away!!",5, June 2018
3148241,"if you looking for a bit quiet beach compared to Patong beach, i recommend you may choose this beach for swimming, taking a walk, sun stunning that you can easily spend a day time here, water is clear and clean, sands are small and white. Access the street, you can explore its market, a lot of food stalls, retail shops, message and convenient shops, everything  you need that you can find there.",5, June 2018
3148242,Karon Beach is a gem of a find. Away from the hustle and bustle of Patong but only a short cab ride away. A good walk to Kata beach and lots to see on the way through. We found lots of places to eat and have a nice cold beer. Karon beach is kept well and lifeguards are on duty. Definitely recommend a stay here. Especially at Beyond Resort Karon.,4, June 2018
3148243,There is rubbish all over the beach!Where is there a good beach in Phuket?Nice area but we were very disappointed in the beach. It was very dirty with rubbish everywhere the water was very rough was hoping for a nice day and a swim.,1, June 2018
3148244,"It is a very nice beach; way much better than Patong! The beach/sea water has layers of blue as well! People behave way more classier and decent at the Karon Beach area. Also, it is bustling with so many restaurants!",4, April 2018
3148245,"It is fantastic !!! The beach was just opposite our resort barely 2 min walk so we visited it in the evening briefly but one can spend close to 3-4 hrs. here. The sand is clean and so is the water ,there are also other activities during the day but it is for certain timings only as we went late in the evening it was all closed.One can enjoy a swim and relax .Plenty of restaurants are available just across this beach but vegetarians have few choices .A little further up there are shops where one can shop for jewellery ,clothes etcetc.",4, April 2018
3148248,We stayed at Karon Sea Sands Resort which was awesome and cheeeeeeaaaaap! Karon Beach is across the road and was beautiful! Don't wear expensive sunnies in the waves though because they will 100% get lost (like mine) due to the strong tides. Although thankfully there was a dude with 600 pairs on his head that strolls down the beach selling them and were super cheap. Will definitely recommend staying in Karon and seeing this beach,5, April 2018
3148249,"We have returned for a second time and will be returning again in the future. This beach is by far the best, in our opinion, kept clean and not too crowded. We just love the local area for walking along the beach and the nearby shopping. Great area for singles and families. Good choice of accommodation nearby.",4, April 2018
3148253,The water is something you see only on the movies. Spectacular! Lots of banana chairs and umbrellas. It is a very open long beach that is semi busy. Activities are alive on the beach as with any other beach around.,5, June 2018
3148256,"Karon beach was located right opposite side of our hotel so we used to go there quite often. Beach is nice and clear with lot of beach shacks on the beach.loved the huge coconuts their, didn't find food cheap though. It would cost almost same to eat here or at any good diner so we avoided it. Activities like parasailing and jetskiing are available at reasonable prices.",3, May 2018
3148257,"lovely view from top of the hill, very relaxing, can take pictures with live eagle bird, easy parking, good spot for picnic lovers and kids to play",5, May 2018
3148259,Nice beach area in Phuket.  The sand is funny here - it squeaks when you walk on it!  Huge beach area for laying out and some shady spots too.  Restaurants & shops nearby.,4, May 2018
3148261,Karon area is good with some international chain properties along with good choices of food and beach activities.,4, January 2018
3148262,"Another which sand beach, you can enjoy the big waves there. Other than normal swimming behaviors.....There are people playing parachute with speed boat. Also there are ""models"" take photos. I am not sure whether they are professional or not.",4, May 2018
3148263,The beach appear to be relatively clean and it looks like the locals pay a lot of attention to keep it that way. However once is a while you might see something floating in the water. Be aware of sudden rips that might pull an innocent swimmer out - don;t panic. Let the current carry you out and then swim parallel to the beach where it is calm and come back ashore preserving as much energy as possible.,4, May 2018
3148264,"We were staying at the Village Hotel and Spa, which was quite close to the beach area.  Nice sandy beach - busy because of Songkran with lots of local Thais.  Saw a large coach party enjoying parasailing.  Lovely sunsets.  A strip of bars/restaurants opposite the beach, near a lake.",4, April 2018
3148266,Nice beach. Not as in you face as Patong and more family friendly. I like the food stalls in the area. The temple market is great. Try the crickets and scorpions!,5, May 2018
3148268,"For a quieter experience, Karon Beach is a great spot. Has the beach chairs and umbrellas if needed with shops and restaurants just off the beach road.If you have kids, it is a bit deep as soon as you enter, but once past the initial waves it is great with nice clear warm water",4, May 2018
3148269,"Karon Beach was just a 7 minute walk from my hostel, and I went there every single day. It is WAAAAY less crowded than the popular Patong beach and way fewer people trying to sell you stuff, although there are some. There are a few restaurants right along the street, close enough to walk to and buy some food or nice, fruity drinks if you want some. I bought a coconut and inside was the strongest pina colada of my life, it was delicious. Mainly, this place is family friendly. I went by myself each day, no one bothered me and I saw a ton of people just enjoying themselves. Also, I mean LOOK at those pictures! The place is simply breathtaking!",5, February 2018
3148272,"Look, I see the appeal in parts. But from the majority of what I saw of Karon Beach, this is a dirty, unkempt beach area. We stayed across the street so it’s not like we didn’t see the beach. What I saw in large parts of the beach was trash, half-shanties, and one close encounter with a big rat. The few nicer areas brought this up to a three...just don’t come here expecting some pristine beach. The best way to enjoy it is to pick your spots carefully or enjoy the sunset from a nice bar overlooking the beach.",3, May 2018
3148273,I had a wonderful time... you can rent chairs on the beach... food vendors near... awesome time... no complaints,5, May 2018
3148274,Spent a couple of days on this beach as it was far less crowded than Patong beach. It has clean water and soft sand....could just do with a few more amenities!,4, May 2018
3148276,Beautiful beach with white send. Good restaurants are there near the beach where you can hangout. And this beach is near road side .,5, May 2018
3148277,"I love Karon compared to Kamala or Patong beach.It is peaceful there and the sand is pretty amazing. Sunset and sunrise must see! Although this area is quiet and less crowded like Patong, it is still walking distance to necessities like cheaper restaurants, 711, massage parlor, market. Kamala, although it is nice and quiet,  is way far and must take taxi to get to the main city. You'll always end up eating in the hotel.Strongly recommend Karon!",4, May 2018
3148278,Amazing beach Very clean and not much crowded good for families and couples to visit there are many activities available in beach boat ride etc.,5, May 2018
3148280,"Like this beach. Walking early morning catch the warm sea bath,wonderful warm sea in April.   Escape from cold weather from Edmonton , Canada.   We enjoys the beach,the sun, and get Tan for home.   At the beach we can excercise, Gym equipments on the side road near the beach.   We can use most of morning, It always too hot  at noon. There are play ground for children free to public.   I like the beach, we did not stay to see Sun Set,but the sun set into the sea.  The new project,will be safety camera on the beach.   I wish to visit this beach again.   You should visit,it is clean and safe. Enjoy The Sun and the Sand.",4, April 2018
3148281,Gorgeous white sand beach. Practically had it all to ourselves. Life savers had their flags up but ocean was quite calm. No one hassles you. Much more peaceful than Patong.Just a short stroll down the hill from our resort,4, May 2018
3148282,"Nice beach close to Karon Town. Lot's of activities on beach such as jetski hire, tubing, parasailing, massages.",5, April 2018
3148283,"Just stayed in Karon Beach, a lovely and quiet beach in Phuket with restaurant choices, shops and everything you need. Please however stay at the northern end where the small town is, as the beach is clean there. Unfortunately we took a walk all the way along the beach and half way down, the beach is just full of litter, it's EVERYWHERE and also in the sea. Why can't people take their litter with them or put it in a bin? It's unfortunately ruined half the beach so we turned back to our usual spot in the northern end! I'm assuming they only clean the northern end as it's where the town, and most of the hotels, are. A fun beach with big waves and soft sand, just choose the right end!!",4, May 2018
3148285,"I walked along this beach during my stay in the Karon area and have to say it was much quieter than Kata beach, although it could have been just a coincidence. Seemed pretty clean and the sand was lovely; wish I'd have had the chance to stay  around for longer, as there seemed to be a nice chilled out vibe to the place. Would definitely go back.",4, January 2018
3148286,I never seen so clean beach. Very quietbeach to relax and enjoying holiday no body coming to disturb no vender easy to hire chair and get local food that I love.,5, May 2018
3148288,"Great way to spend hours. Clean, and friendly area.100 baht pp for use of cushioned plastic sun lounge for the whole day.Public toilet opens around 9 or 10am...10 baht toilet, 20 for shower.Dont have towel?... we payed 500 baht for 2 brand spanker beach towels.",5, May 2018
3148289,"The beach was good ..clean but nothing special to talk about. Just any other city beach. I might be biased with krabi beaches that I visited before this . Kata might be a better choice ( I only visited patong, Karon and kata)",3, May 2018
3148291,"What a beach! We stayed near by at the old Phuket and walked down. It wasn’t ever too busy but was normally clean. We would rent umbrellas for 250 baht for the day for 2 of us. Lots of places to get drinks and food nearby. We would bring a cooler full of drinks and food and relax for the day. Beautiful sand and clear water. Been to several resorts throughout Mexico and the Caribbean, the water and sand was amazing",5, May 2018
3148294,Karon is ideally located. Plenty of shops and bar. Lots of places to eat and drink. Beach is lovely. Everywhere closes by midnight at this time if year. There are lots of bars with live bands. Karon holds a market on a Tuesday and Friday well worth a visit,4, May 2018
3148295,We had a very nice fewdaysrelaxing on the beach resort was nicethe swell can quite high the water was warm.,5, April 2018
3148297,"I went from Patong to the northern side of Karon Beach and I must admit I felt much better than at the former. Less crowded (albeit with decent amount of people), less touts, yet accessible shops and vendors for when you have that little craving.",4, February 2018
3148298,Excellent clean beach...calm waters very pleasant....long beach...lovely views....sum palm trees around for shade .Wil definitely go again...,5, March 2018
3148301,A quieter alternative to Patong Beach. Has quite a few stores and money exchange places bar far less than Patong beach. Quite a few popular resorts and hotels here.,4, May 2018
3148304,"Excellent time had by all 9 of us, plenty to do & see and the price is right. Food was fantastic and soooo many places to try. Excellent thumbs up",4, May 2018
3148306,"En mayo playa desierta prácticamente.Perfecta para huir de aglomeraciones. Sin ruidos de coches, sin música de bares...",5, May 2018
3148307,"Karon beach is one of the cleanest beaches we have come across in Thailand ,downside plenty of little bities in the water & Karon is overrun with Russians",4, April 2018
3148309,"Nice beach worth a visit we stayed in Karon for 17 days and only visited this beach twice, a lot nicer beaches in Phuket but this is not the worst, the sea is very choppy at times from what I seen and beds are 100 baht each which I think is reasonable",4, May 2018
3148311,The approach from the road is a bit littered. The beach is clean and doesn’t feel too crowded considering how long the beach is. Waves do get a bit rough. But fun!,4, April 2018
3148312,"Well this year was my second year in Karon, and going back next year. The Beach is one of the best around it's so long that there is plenty of room for everyone. The sunbeds were 200 Baht which is really not bad. Shops and hotels all near by and prices are really good, as are the people, but watch out because you will burn as the sun is so hot so careful just how long you want to stay 2 or 3 hours was enough for me.Gift shops. bars, ice cream are only minutes away taking a pushchair on to the beach is hard anywhere, but there are grass areas joining the beach",5, March 2018
3148313,"Pernoctaba en Patong , pero fue muy agradable ciertos desplazamientos a  KARON Beach , entre muchas cosas es menos agobiante que la vecuna playa de Patong y al mismo tiempo aconsejaria a todo viajero apersonarse a KARON  view point , las maravillosas vistas recompensan el viaje",4, April 2018
3148314,"some big breakers when we were there which enables us to do novice surfing, all the fun rides available the only problem was the toilet being a 500m walk and over the road",4, April 2018
3148315,"Stayed for 10 days, in the quiet season. Yes, it is quiet here, well, as quiet as it gets. Let’s just say I probably wouldn’t want to see the busy season.The beach at the Southern and Northern ends has some litter. We stayed in the middle and it was really pretty. Comparable to our beaches in Australia. There’s no surf to speak of, as in, Beach break. Very calm. I’d say the headland would be ok. If you want reasonably relaxing surroundings this is probably your best bet. Patong to the North was hectic as, Kata to the south was a nice beach as well but in my opinion not as nice. My advice is hire a bike, unlike Chiang Mai, things are pretty spread out here and your cheapest Tuk Tuk (which is actually a red cab) but they call it Tuk Tuk, is 200 baht l, a go, starting price. To get anywhere that is more than 1 kilometre starts to add up, like for instance, Patong 400 baht, Kata 300 baht, Phuket 700 baht. If you want a full on night life this is not your place. It is mainly filled with Russians whom the locals say, stay and drink in their hotel rooms mainly. We went out a fair bit and we were it. Karon just down the road is a little busier with a bit more night life.",4, May 2018
3148316,"We found Karon beach lovely for a swim or an evening walk, very close to a variety of restaurants and hotels.",5, April 2018
3148319,We have spent 6days here for our honeymoon. My husband and I love the beach it is so clean and great to swim.,5, May 2018
3148320,Karon beach is the best for relaxing and spending on a day time when sun shine. We have enjoyed our holidays in karon. We definily gonna come back again in karon for our next holiday.,5, May 2018
3148322,"Whilst staying in Karon we were pleasantly surprised that the beach is nice and quiet in comparison to Patong which was great for our two small kids. Granted, Patong is slightly better in terms of sand and water but overall we preferred the laid back aura at Karon. 100baht per sun bed and we were set for the day.",4, May 2018
3148323,"We had great fun on the beach and the water was so warm. Massage, restaurant, sunbeds and umbrellas available on beach with shops close by. We had great fun with our Lilo water bed and the sea was good with our grandchildren who are 12 and 9 years old. Felt very safe. Would recommend this beach for all ages.",4, April 2018
3148324,"I am a fan of beaches with white sand and crystal clear waters like the beaches in Ko Lipe, Thailand. I've seen beaches like this in England, and that's saying something! Busy beach. Golden sands. Parasailing. Restaurants bars and shops.",3, April 2018
3148325,"Love KaronIt's friendlyEasily accessible to various attractionsWalking distance to market s, pubs and restaurantsRecommended if you want a relaxed laid back holiday destination",5, May 2018
3148330,"Sandy beach with umbrellas and lounges for hire. Massages available on the beach semi private. The sand is fine and although no surf, it was very clean. Close to shops.",4, April 2018
3148331,"Karon, Kata and Kata Noi are my favourite beaches in Phuket.  All have beautiful soft sand and crystal blue water but Karon seems to be busier and the area isn't as clean as Kata and Kata Noi.  I didn't like the dirty little river feeding into the sea on the far left side of this beach.  It has lots of water sports and places to eat and drink.",4, April 2018
3148333,"Huge long lovely beach , sunbed 100 baht for the day , Great swimming , and life  guards to.There is some big waves which I had fun on but could be difficult for younger children",4, April 2018
3148336,Beautiful beach but FULL of tourists and very boring. Kata offers many more activities. If you like to just sunbath without much movement and close to bars it might be good for you.,3, April 2018
3148337,"Beach is lovely, not too crowded, sea lovely and warm but waves a bit strong at times, i am a non swimmer! Very family orientated.",4, April 2018
3148338,A great beach. Calm clear waters and endless options of food drink and accomodation nearby. The northern end has a great group of beachside restaurants with delicious cheap food. To the southern end is a rocky outcrop with good snorkelling too,5, April 2018
3148339,"What can I say, Karon Beach is great. Food options galore. Safe fir kids - you can rent a beach chair for 100 BHT. loved Karon beach",5, April 2018
3148340,"Unlike the beaches in Puerto Vallarta where there’s chairs, umbrellas and many of the hotels have there own section of beach to cater toward there customers Karon is a true beach. When we came it was not over crowded and the few vendors we saw are not overly pushy or aggressive. Para-sailing is available on the beach but most individuals either just sun bathe, walk the beach and or play in the water. A life guard is on duty depending on the section of beach you are on. Just pay attention and you will be fine. Oh yes last but not least  I know my hotel supplied us with Beach Towels I cannot say the same with the other resorts so it’s not a bad idea to pack your own just in case. Come see for yourself you won’t be disappointed.",5, April 2018
3148343,"We just  stayed in Karon Beach for 12 days. It was a great base for exploring the island of Phuket. The beach itself is long and wide with the water being mostly very calm, due to the bay it sits in. It wasn’t very busy when we were there which was also great. There are lots of restaurants along the beach both at the far end toward Patong, where we stayed and more centrally near Karon town.We stayed at the Novatel, Karon beach which was a very family oriented hotel. It’s across the road from the beach and a short walk into Karon. It’s also a 5-10 minute trip into much busier Patong.There are lots of great restaurants in town. Our favourite was Two Chefs, great food and lovely staff and management( they also make yummy cocktails!!!)You can catch a local bus from the main temple in Karon. For 40 baht it will take you all the way to Old Phuket town, the weekend night markets, Chalong Temple or one of the big shopping malls. A great bargain and a fun way to travel.So, Karon Beach is beautiful, the people are lovely, there’s great food and cheap massages( Apple Massage was my favourite)What’s not to love?  A great place to stay!️",4, April 2018
3148344,"Karon beach, the actual beach is beautiful. A good alternative to Patong. Good selection of hotels, resorts and restaurants. Good central location on the island.",3, April 2018
3148345,The best time to visit Karon Beach is the early mornings around 6:00 a.m. when there is very less crowed and only walking tourist all around. Sea is generally calm and no touts or sellers to disturb you. Sea beach is very clean and people enjoy swimming there. Great location in Phuket.,5, April 2018
3148346,"It baffles me when people say this beach is clean. No, it is not. It is not even close to clean. There are massive rivers and streams of poo (not treated) going into the ocean in both ends and that raw material is diluted (not much, unfortunately) in the water you are swimming. BUT, it is the cleanest I could find. It is big, it is almost beautiful, definitely not paradisiac (no such thing in Phuket). The water temperature is fantastic though.If you are going to south Phuket this is the beach to keep you happy, but if you are still undecided if Phuket is a good beach destination, don't go and save yourself from disappointment. Unless you are used to really rubbish beaches, Phuket will not add any value to a beach holiday.",3, March 2018
3148348,"Super promenade en bord de mer, shopping, cocktails et soleilOn y trouve de tout, plaisir de s y rendre en tuk tuk",4, February 2018
3148349,Love Beach like  to hangout  and Walk along the beach and sit. White sands clean and safe recommend for to go there,4, April 2018
3148351,"We walked along the beach early every morning before the heat got too stupid and just enjoyed being there. Lots of people had the same idea so there were good people watching options. The main one for us was watching people who had hired photographers flouncing around,go look and see.We were staying at the Beyond resort right at the end of the beach so didn't have to hire loungers etc,we enjoyed the beach without actually being on it during the day.I would say this is the best beach in the area.",5, March 2018
3148353,What a lovely place with a great clean beach and safe. The area is full of good quality hotels and lots of restaurants one of the best we found was Bai Toey which was good Thai cuisine between the Old Phuket Hotel and the beach on Karon road. Try it you won’t be disappointed. We ate there more than once and enjoyed it each time and that is very rare for us to return to the same place.,4, April 2018
3148354,"Great to visit, clean sand and very friendly people around. If you are in Phuket this is definitely a beach worth seeing.",4, April 2018
3148355,"Lovely beach and wasn’t too busy. Very clean although we struggled to find a bin! Last time I visited Karon was in June 2015, and I remember the water being extremely choppy and we weren’t allowed in the water due to the riptides. It wasn’t the case this time and the water water very calm. I guess it changes within the next few months",5, April 2018
3148356,"The beach wasn’t overly busy, on a 33 day. The water was beautiful and the lifeguards were on duty.",5, April 2018
3148357,"Much quieter and less hectic than Patong Beach. Not as many food shops and such, but not as many hawkers either.",4, February 2018
3148359,"this is a very beatiful and calm beach at the best cost of Phuket, I recommend it. There are good and no so expensive hotels in this place.",4, April 2018
3148362,"I used this beach very much because I stayed at the Hilton. Quiet, quiet and immaculate beach. the mess inside the city and the crowd does not exist here. Nature, sea and you. The water is sometimes very hot but clean and crystal clear. But when the beggining soma starts the tide, it goes back 90-100 meters and it gets a bit blurry.",5, April 2018
3148366,"With a distance like 15 mins away from central Patong, this is basically my most recommended beach in Phuket as not as crowded as other beach in this city. Clean beach, beautiful sunset and still a convenient location. Restaurants nearby and honestly. I will much prefer to stay in this beach more than the others.",5, April 2018
3148367,"While living in Singapore, Karon Beach became a destination of choice for relaxing long weekends.  Thought we would visit again after having left the regions a number of years ago.  We stayed at a local hotel but as we wandered the streets and enjoyed the beach we were overcome by the stench from the open sewers, annoyed by the crabby, rude, and downright impolite vendors and store clerks, the traffic was madness and the infrastructure was crumbling all around us.  All these changes made for a bad experience.  Not coming back to Phuket.",1, April 2018
3148368,"This beach is just beautiful, fine sand for miles and not too many boats to destroy the atmosphere.Could spend a week in the warm waters which are so clear.",5, April 2018
3148369,"We’ve been to Phuket many times for the past twelve years and Karon had always been our favourite beach. It is not as crowded as Patong, yet not too far away from the necessary amenities and good food. However, we are very disappointed that this trip since our last visit four years ago did not give us the same positive feelings about Thailand anymore. The influx of tourists from certain countries with many lacking in manners and consideration for others seems to have taken a toll on the locals. They have become less friendly and even rude to customers at times. We no longer experience the land of smiles, and customer service is poor if it exists at all. The infrastructure does not support the increase in the number of tourists visiting, and the whole place stunk like an open sewer. While we have met some friendly people this time, we are unlikely to visit this island again.",2, April 2018
3148371,Nice clean activity beach. Lots of safety regulations with the jet skis and paragliders. Lots of good restaurants too.,4, April 2018
3148373,"We had a great time in Phuket in March.  It was very hot, but was to be expected and was a welcome change from the weather in our home state of Michigan.  I would highly advise visiting this beautiful island.  We had an excursion every day and visited many locations on the main island as well as many small islands in the surrounding area.  I would not recommend this vacation for small children as the ones we saw seemed to be quite bored.  Teens would likely enjoy and of course adults.  The nightlife was amazing and much calmer than Patong.  So many places to see and eat great food.  Highly recommend!",5, March 2018
3148374,"Stayed for 10 days at Old Phuket Hotel, just off Karon beach.  The beach itself is lovely with soft white sand.  It was very hot in April but you can hire beach chairs (pair) for 200 baht (£5 approx.) which are well worth while.  The beach is long in nature but you are warned about rip tides on it and what to do.  There are the usual array of surf boats, jet skis and para-gliding to partake of.  A lovely beach to visit and about 400 yeards from our hotel.  There is also a corniche on it with stacks of small shops and restaurants.",5, April 2018
3148376,What a beautiful beach! A must visit place in Phuket! The water was not polluted as there were not many shops/stores/restaurants behind the beach. Unfortunately the red flag was raised that day and I haven't enjoyed swimming.,5, April 2018
3148377,Beach is nicer and less crowded than patong. White sand and there are water sea sport activities to choose from here as well,5, April 2018
3148378,The beach was stunning . Sun beds were 100bahts each plus a umbrella. The sea was sometimes choppy . It was nice to go and have a dip when the weather was so hot.There was a lot of sellers up and down selling anything from ice lolly’s to hammocks. After a few hours it got on your nerves. There was supermarkets over the road if you needed refreshments.,5, March 2018
3148383,"Beautiful beach, gets quite busy but it is lovely. Arrive early to beat the crowds. Right in the town with lots to see and do.",4, April 2018
3148384,Really nice and less crowded than Paring. Water is warm. Across from Hilton hotel. Not too many fish but the water is clear.,5, April 2018
3148388,"We didn’t use this beach a great deal as our hotel had a lovely pool area but it is a great place. It has something for everyone and whether it is lone travellers, couples or families with children there is lots to do.The beach itself is lovely white sand and it’s nice to walk along if you want some exercise. There are lots of shops, bars and restaurants along the way and sunbeds with umbrellas can be rented cheaply.",5, April 2018
3148389,Karon beach is pretty busy but a lovelt long stretch of clean sand. There are lots of water sports going on. There are some sun lounger but most people just lay on the sand. The sea can be quite rough and we were bitten a lot by sea mites while swimming.,4, April 2018
3148391,"Value for money, professional  friendly and prompt service, amazing shirts and other garments purchased from Sam at a very reasonable price. All ways has the products ready when promised and have never had any comebacks",5, April 2018
3148392,"Clean beach, less crowded/dirty than Patong Beach. The water was clean, however I was expecting crystal clear blue water with warm sand, and none of the beaches on Phuket really offer that.",3, January 2018
3148394,Early morning this beach is amazing but by 10am it's very busy . The sand is so fine it squeaks when you walk on it .plenty of Sunbeds to rent 200bht.a day. & the rocky area behind the beyond hotel provides good snorkelling with many different colourful fish to see.,4, April 2018
3148396,Karon beach is very big beach with very good views  ok for swimming etc..mostly crowded  but since its big it accomadates  2 beds .  1Umbrella u can get on beach which is a standard price in Phuket..,4, March 2018
3148399,Much nicer than Patong because it’s not crowded. The food here is also delicious. I felt safer walking around at night. The small shops in the plaza were nice. Overall a great beach!,5, April 2018
3148400,best beach in terms of location and connectivity. just 20 minutes away by bike from the patong beach.,5, March 2018
3148401,"Karon Beach , lovely place to visit , night markets near beach are awesome , restaurants and food in Karon are great , bars are good and friendly people , the Thai people make you welcome and never stop smiling",5, April 2018
3148404,We booked to stay in the Karon resort in Phuket so that we could dip in and out of the madness of Patong as we wanted a chilled out holiday. Having done trips to other parts of Thailand we realised that there are much more scenic places to stay. Karon Beach is large and crowded and nowhere near as pretty as the beaches we saw in Krabi and Phi Phi. Areas of the resort were pretty smelly and felt quite unclean...that said it was much more chilled out than Patong. It depends what you are looking for in Thailand but if I  were to visit the country again I would visit Krabi for sure.,3, April 2018
3148405,Karon beach is lovely. Very happy to have picked this area to stay over the others. Appeared to me to be more cleaner but do check cleanliness of toilets before choosing your restaurant!!! X,5, March 2018
3148406,"Karon beach is a great place. Close enough to visit patong but far enough away for some peace and quiet! Good street markets, nice restaurants and a beautiful long beach. Sun beds are 200 baht for 2 beds plus an umbrella. Sea is beautiful and lots of activities offered along the beach. Good nightlife but all closes pretty early, around 10-10:30pm.",5, April 2018
3148407,This beach is ever so clean. The sand makes a bizarre squeaking noise underfoot which is quite a delight to hear. There are plenty of bars and restaurants just on the other side of the road. I am unsure if there are umbrellas etc to hire as we visited near sundown each day. The heat is quite intense!,5, April 2018
3148408,i love karon beach as its clear and beautiful. just like kata noi and kata. these beaches should be an option rather than patong beach,5, March 2018
3148409,"Karon Beach was very beautiful, but lacks shade other than the 100 baht chairs/umbrellas.  The day we were there a massive rain storm came and lasted for an hour before we packed up and left.  Keep in mind that we are from Seattle and very use to rain...and out waiting it.  There were taxi's easily available at the stand down the main street.  We had several hours here before the rain came in and loved it.  There were A LOT of beach sellers around, but they were easily put off by a polite ""no thank you.""  This is a vast sandy beach with beautiful green water.  This beach was suggested to us by the tour desk of our hotel in Patong...she said it was one of the cleaner large beaches around, and I would agree.  There was a pretty strong undercurrent that made me nervous for the little kids playing away from their parents, but everyone seemed to be having fun.  I would not have let my 7 year old play alone in this water.  This beach was much nicer than Patong Beach, but Patong was a better place to stay for us-more shops, markets, restaurants etc.  We did not once go in the water at Patong solely based on what it looked like.  And we jumped right into Karon Beach's water.  It cost us 300 Baht to take a taxi from Patong to Karon...and as a side note that taxi turned out to be a karaoke taxi...complete with microphone, flip down video screen, disco light and tamborine... it felt like Cash Cab and made the ride feel like it was not far at all.",4, April 2018
3148411,"Not too bad, but not too clean, many people,  water was ok. A bit disappointing for a ""white sand clear water Thai beach""...",3, April 2018
3148412,"We are currently staying at Centara Grand Beach Resort which is situated at the Patong end of Karon Beach, the beach is great for a walk and there is a lot to do, the sea is also lovely for a swim but there is a strong current so beware of that.",4, April 2018
3148416,"Our first day in Karon we decided to go to the beach.. it was sooo overcrowded and a struggle to get a sunbed. Even so when we did I felt like i should of been having lunch with the person next to us we were sat that close! The sand is lovely when you get down to the sea however the further back you go it is very dirty and full of rubbish.. I.e. cigarette buts, dead rats, plastic etc.We visited Nai Harn beach and this was 100 x's better! Don't waste your days on Karon beach.. get a took took to Nai Harn, it is well worth it!",3, March 2018
3148419,"Posiblemente uno de los peores lugares que vi en mi vida. Una playa completamente sucia, llena de gente que fuma y se amontona. Inexplicable.",1, March 2018
3148420,"For us, this was a quieter beach to go to compared to Patong up the road and we are so happy we stayed here.Highly recommend the beach, very clean and clear water and no issues with swimming and rips or undertows. The beach is up there with the best I have swam in anywhere in the world and I have been to some places.",5, March 2018
3148421,Karon beach at everything I see the sun very beautiful .At Karon beach we have  many  thai food restaurant offeringdelicious.,5, April 2018
3148422,"As compared to Patong, this area is less busy& crowded so you can really enjoy lounging in the beach and walking around the shops. There's also lot of reasonably priced seafood places for dinner.",5, March 2018
3148424,The beach and shops plus restaurants along the parallel roadside offer tourists a lot of scope. Day and night. Please be careful of rip tides. There have been several drownings. It will help if you speak Russian.,4, March 2018
3148426,"It’s a very nice beach, they rent sunbeds and there are small kiosks where you can buy cold drinks. You can also rent jet-ski and other water-activities. I feel this is a safe beach. Nice and clean.",4, April 2018
3148429,"Big, sandy, long...but unfortunately rather overcrowded, disappointingly dirty and full of tourists (sadly mostly Russian it would seem) who have little time and respect for local culture, people or the environment. Better options heading further south towards Kata Noi",3, April 2018
3148430,Loved this place so much last year couldn’t wait to return. There is something for everyone at this resort. Costs about 400bht for a taxi to Paton which is really busy.,5, March 2018
3148431,"Quite busy during our 3 week holiday,seemed that you needed to be down early for beds and umbrellas.many activities on beach,paragliding,volleyball, etc,beach slightly  dirty from road,but when you have gone 30 yds its nice and clean.gymnasium  (free) chromed at each end of the beach.6 or so pieces. Many bars directly across a very busy road plus restaurants. Nice walk to Kata beach.",4, March 2018
3148433,"Great place for families. We never got hasseled, or harrased and felt safe walking around at all times.  Loved the markets and people.  Beautiful beach for swimming.",5, March 2018
3148434,"We booked a hotel at Karon Beach that was directly across the street specifically because we wanted easy access to the beach and sea and some of the reviews sounded like it was clear and beautiful. However, after checking into our hotel we crossed the street to the beach and discovered it was filthy (cigarette butts, wrappers and garbage among the trees) and incredibly crowded to the point of being uncomfortable. The water itself appeared clear and the sunset view from the beach is lovely, if you don't mind standing there among a kazillion tourists to watch it.  There were a number of families with children and it seemed like the kids were having a great time in the water though. There are people para-sailing overhead, which was interesting to watch. When you get closer to the water the beach becomes cleaner, but among the trees in the shade and near the beach chairs it is dirty and disheartening.After the initial disappointment, I gave the beach another try in the morning when there were fewer people there. I walked through the garbage-littered trees again and decided to sit down in one of the many rows of now mostly unoccupied beach chairs facing the sea for a few moments. Soon after sitting down, I was accosted by what I was later told was one of  the ""beach mafia"" who was standing there with a rake, not cleaning up the dirty beach but instead harassing me to pay him baht to sit in a chair, even though it is a public beach (directly across from our hotel) and most of the chairs were empty that time of the morning. He yelled and threatened me until I finally got up and left, as I was not going to pay baht to sit among garbage.This is not the beach we imagined from the photos, nor from other reviews here that we have read. You would think they would make more of an effort to keep this beach clean. Sorry we came here; it was the low point of our visit to Thailand.",2, March 2018
3148437,"Comparing the Patong  & Karon beaches, I'd like to choose Karon beach.It is a little far from the Patong city  so less people are there . Lovely sands, beautiful birds  & silent area are some advantages of this beautiful beach",5, March 2018
3148438,"i just visited the south end of Karon Beach... I walked from Kata. Lovely, well worth a visit. I was partic impressed at the variety (and price) of the food and drink around here! Phad Thai's for 60 Bhat from the beach restaurants, Mojito's from street vendors for 50 Bhat... Great value!",4, March 2018
3148439,Very close to alkt of hotels very clear water in the low populated areas and very fun activities also there are people who sell alot of handy stuff for example ice cream,5, March 2018

3148443,"Only a few minutes up from patong beach, is Karon beach.  200% better. Clean, friendly, not as drunken and raucous, good for us, unless drunken is what you are in to. Nothing wrong with that. Markets Tuesday and Friday.  Good food and bar choices, locals lovely.",4, March 2018
3148447,"One should definitely visit Kata Beach while in Phuket. It's a very clear beach with mild waves. Surrounded by small hills and lush greens, it looks absolutely wonderful.",5, March 2018
3148448,"We were taken to the most popular view points and a few other highlights on the Sunday, after our arrival and this was truly a remarkable way to see some of the highlights of Phuket!",5, March 2018
3148449,"There are a very number of visitors to Karon Beach but there are no toilets or showers, there is piles of litter all over the place and the traffic.....you have to see it to believe it. Very high levels of exhaust polluction",3, March 2018
3148450,"Karon Beach with its long beach stretch and the town adjactent to it is in my eyes the ideal combination for being at a nice beach (better than e.g. Patong) but not far from some ressources that a town offers. The beach is clean, the water is warm and shallow. Some activites as parasailing and jet-ski are offered. Sunbeds and umbrellas can be rented. Moving around, if not walking on the beach, has become expensive as the ""taxi"" and tuktuk organisations fixed the prices and now ask for 200 baht just for a short hop. For me it is now even more important to choose a centrally located hotel, in walking distance of e.g. beach / town / restaurants.",4, March 2018
3148453,"As I first time  here, can say, that is lovely  place to stay!Much Sun,The nature  is beautiful!A lot of restaurants and bars! Fruts are so different  and tasty!!!!Hope to visit this place again!",5, March 2018
3148454,"Have traveled to Phuket many times and i have noticed the improvement in the beach area.The beach was calm with little waves for this time of the year. I have also noticed that a number of beach chairs and umbrella's are up which were once removed. The beach was clean with cleaners working each morning and afternoon to keep it that way, will return soon",5, March 2018

3148457,"Large beach with beautiful soft sand and lovely warm sea! Watersports available to hire (Jet skis. parasailing, banana boats etc).Sun loungers and umbrellas also available for hire, but we arrived at 10am one day and they were all taken so arrive early (or later in the afternoon) if you want one. Lots of people take their own parasols. Beach vendors walk up and down selling fruit/drinks/ice creams but are not pushy or overbearing.Lots of restaurants and places to get cold drinks on the promenade behind beach. As the beach is so big, even when ‘busy’ it doesn’t feel overcrowded.",4, March 2018
3148458,Karon beach pantainya lebih panjang dari dari pantai lain. Kalau nak private pantai boleh pergi sini. Karon beach tak terlalu penuh dengan orang. Pantai dan air lautnya cantik,5, March 2018
3148461,"If you are heading to Phuket for the first time, then this should be on your list of potential places to stay. The town is a good size with plenty of shops, bars, and restaurants to choose from but is not as crazy and chaotic as Patong. However, it is still a close cab ride if you want to head to Patong at night for more action. The beach is beautiful and the water is clam, clear, and warm. Along the beach road there are plenty of shops and restaurants which is perfect. We also visited Patong, Surin and Kamala beach on this trip...all of which are nice. Surin has a beautiful beach, but it lacks the amenities that are found at the other beaches. Patong itself is a zoo...lots and lots of people. Kamala would be a good option to stay as well, but Karon is bigger and you have more options in Karon. Be prepared to be surrounded by Russians. We went in Phuket in March 2018 and Russian is the predominant language you will hear around you (at all beaches). In fact, I didn't hear many other languages being spoken on my trip. Don't worry though, most Thai people speak some level of English at the beach and you should be fine. The menus will be in English, Thai, and many times also in Russian.  If you are worried about language problems, you can buy a SIM card at the airport for your phone so that you have Google translate with you, but it isn't necessary. Overall, I would highly recommend staying at Karon beach...it has everything you need.",5, March 2018
3148464,Great for swimming much better than patong. Very hot and no shade. You can hire mats and there is drinks for sale.,3, March 2018

3148475,The beach is stunning & never crowded. You have to be careful in sea as current changes very quickly & you can be swept into waves. There is water sports you can do & people selling different items along beach but never bother you. Fabulous walk along beach with sea air to cool you down in the heat. Fabulous.,5, February 2018

The entrances to this beach are strewn with litter and there are few if any bins.We only went on two occasions because of this, we took a taxi to Kata beach and although we managed to get beds it was not much better and not worth the trip.  The water is warm and inviting but the area is not.",3, February 2018
3148543,"I would say Karon Beach is much better than Patong Beach as it is less crowded than Patong beach. The water is also clearer than Patong Beach. There jet ski and parasailing activities here too.The only drawback is that there’s no safe swimming zone separated out with the zone for the jet ski or speed boat coming and go. There’s a life guard watch tower but no life guard is to be seen. Not sure whether it’s the guard not wearing anything identifiable or there isn’t any on duty at the time we were there.We arrived at around 4pm and the sun was very hot. We rented two sunbathing chairs along with a huge umbrella shading us at 200Baht, for unlimited time. It’s nice just lying on it with your sunglasses on, either reading on your favorite book or just to take a nap. The breeze was nice despite the hot striking sun.There’s a place for shower, opposite the Karon Beach, across the road, behind a complex (around 200meters away from Karon Beach) costing 20Baht/person.There’s also few restaurants lining in a stretch along the road opposite the Karon Beach.The sunset view was beautiful.

We went walking around the beach and spoke to a few store owners who suggested to go to a nearby beach called Karon beach. It was a good decision to go to Karon beach. The beach was very beautiful and very less crowded. Or I guess the beach is very long and hence you don't really get the feeling of it being stuffy. There are also small stalls / stores to buy souvenirs. You can get a few options of water sports activity at the beach like jet-ski, paragliding, banana ride etc. I suppose the beach is not swim safe and hence there were red flags around.We spent a couple of good hours at this place and had our lunch at the nearby restaurant.",5, January 2018

3148632,One of the best beach I have been to in Thailand.White sandSome waves to playDelimited safe areaEmployees of the resort clean and secure the beach all the time,5, February 2018
3148641,Good beach for swimming & relaxing with no other  water sports activity taking place like in case of Patong beach. View was simply brilliant and waves keep coming in to enjoy all day. Not an option for sports enthusiasts who must go to Patong to enjoy.,4, January 2018
3148650,Blue water and long beach. But it is crowded for this season. Some days water was more dirty than usual,4, January 2018
3148656,Staying 20mins walk from town. Extremely busy and streets are crowded. The pavements are in a terrible condition making it hazardous to walk on. Good market and loots of places to eat.,3, January 2018
3148659,"More relaxed beach comparing to Patong, a lot of space as it is long about 1-2 km, many people but also much space. On the left side is what i believe to be the best snorkeling point on the Western Phuket coast. Good visibility and not too shallow waters.",4, January 2018
3148664,"Nice beach but during our visit it was unbelievable hot so only walked along once ,places dangerous for swimming but flags and lifeguards on duty",4, January 2018
3148669,"Visited Karon Beach twice while in Karon. The beach is nice and long, water is okay. One can rent lounge chairs and umbrellas .  Exercise area between beach and main road which includes lots of children’s playground equipment. Some trees away from beach, providing free shade for those who want it. Lots of restaurants and shops across the road and taxi stand at main road too. Still too crowded with people for me, but not as crowded as Patong Beach.",3, January 2018
3148675,"From our experience, this is the cleanest beach in Phuket. Clean water, clean sand (no bottles or plastic bags). Hotels are a bit more expensive there,but its well worth it. If you are going to a family or want a more quite (than Patong) holiday, a definite recommended beach.",5, January 2018
3148681,Find a nice tuktuk driver and you are set ... show them a map of what sights you would like to see and map a price with them... gives you freedom to see the sights and get the best view points to have amazing photos,4, January 2018
3148684,Omg the beach is beautiful with clear sea and amazing clean sand. We normally don’t do beaches but this one we were there everyday. Apparently better than patong beach. Definitely worth a visit. Had lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Clean and friendly. Great atmosphere.,5, January 2018
3148692,Very busy with Russians and east Europeans desperate for some sun and sand...beach is reasonable....lots of dos and donts about what can be taken onto the beach and what can be done,3, January 2018
3148695,"Our favourite beach in Phuket, easy access from most hotels unlike Kata Beach. Restaurants & shops etc are more upscale. Beach are less crowded too.",5, January 2018
3148698,"Lovely quieter beach about 15 mins drive south from Patong. Clear water, white sands and great for families quieter than Patong Beach but similiar facilities such as food carts, shops, water activities.",4, January 2018
3148699,"After 17 year i found Karon little bit changed, the best spot i think is on the left near the rocks, or at the end in the nord side where there are less people and the beach is large and clean. Good for some days before to explore the rest of Phuket.",4, January 2018
3148701,"We stayed at Karon Beach for 6 nights recently but only went to the beach once. We're not huge beach goers (prefer pool and shopping when in Phuket) and we did get rain a couple of times.The beach is lovely but the deck chairs (that you hire for 200 Baht, around $4 AUS) aren't as close to the waters edge as you can get in other parts of Phuket (like Kamala).  There are also far fewer food vendors on this beach which reduces the variety on offer.We did love the fireworks and lantern releasing on the beach at sunset/night.",4, January 2018
3148703,"We can to Karon Beach after an amazing your of Southern Thailand and to be honest, we were underwhelmed. We read that Karon Beach was less busy and hectic than Kata or the other surrounding beaches, but we still found it really busy. After coming from the chilled, clear blue waters of Khao Lak, this was a real comedown. Thank god we're staying in a gorgeous hotel, or else I would have felt really sad. It doesn't feel like Thailand either. And the constant bothering by local sellers was really annoying. If you want a boozy, busy getaway, great. Otherwise, go to Khao Lak.",1, January 2018
3148709,"Very nice beach! It's quite big and very busy with people. The sand is amazing, the water is way greener/clearer compared to Patong beach. There are people who walk the beach and try to sell you things. You can order drinks from beach walkers as well (for more money than walking to get it yourself). We felt very safe leaving our belongings on the beach while swimming in the ocean.Come to this beach in the evening and you can purchase those lanterns that you light and float into the sky for 100-200 baht, or just watch the ones taking off!",4, January 2018
3148711,"A beautiful beach with loads of restaurants across the road and heaps of activities available on the beach itself ranging from beach volleyball to parasailing. Clear, warm waters and quite a few fish swimming around. Fantastic place to relax.",5, January 2018
3148714,"Pretty good clean beach , nice sand nice water , lots of cafes and shops around for a look  , a short tuk tuk ride from parang usually $200 baht",4, January 2018
3148716,We visited Karon beach around 10 am and it was already a bit crowded.But the beach is very clean and you have lot of good places to it nearby.There are sun beds which can be rented.,5, January 2018
3148717,"My family and I spent quite some time at this beach (the section that faces the Hilton Arcadia Resort). Not very crowded, extremely clean, with green, crystal clear waters... However, the latter are kind of treacherous and if you have young children, you must keep an eye on them at **all times**. Also beware of people with jet skies and motor boats, they surf at close proximity and are at times very unpleasant.",4, January 2018
3148720,Quiet in relation to Patong beach.No visible dirty business.Great beach with nice sandWater sports availableGood for a swim or a a run,4, January 2018
3148725,Very busy beach with constant flow of lucky lucky men. Trying to cross main road to get to beach is dangerous. You take your life in your hands. Sand and sea is lovely if you can put up with the thousands of others on beach.,2, January 2018
3148726,"If you live nearby in Karon it's ok for a day or two, but there are so many better beaches in Phuket.",3, January 2018
3148730,Lovely clean beach good selection of water sports. My son (14yrs) went on the jetski and they were very vigilant about his safety and to not go out of sight of them..very impressed,5, January 2018
3148737,"One of the so many nice beaches in Phuket ... KARON BEACH.Very clean and clear sea water (which is lately not common anymore in these areas).Not a Super Busy beach in water sports, which makes it also quieter and peaceful.Sun beds and sun umbrellas available at 200 baht the whole set (2 sun beds + umbrella)Night time as in other towns ... lots of markets to buy whatever you need and don't need ;)",5, January 2018
3148739,"A really lovely beach with perfect water and sand. It's around 10 km long and you will be able to find almost everything here. If you want jet skies and other water attraction just walk a bit and you will find it, if you want a beach without those stuff walk the other direction and you will only have water and sand. Not over crowded either.",5, January 2018
3148757,"This is the most beautiful and peaceful place on earth. Friendly Thai people, great restaurants and a lot of little shopping stalls.",5, January 2018
3148774,"Average beach nothing special, gets very busy, reminds me of mini Europe beach. Sand is nice and soft however. Water not that warm. Enough shops restaurants near by. Go north of Phuket for nice peaceful beaches. Ok if your a beach person.",3, January 2018
3206878,"Directly situated at the beach, on walking distance from your accommodation. Services, facilities and activities focused on family and children.",4, August 2020
